Title: Improved User Experience with Enhanced Button Click Timeout and Scroll Functionality

Excerpt: Enhancements include optimized scrolling to footer, extended button click timeout, and improved backoff mechanism.

Post Detail: In this update, we have introduced improvements to the user experience within the Heureka component. Users will now benefit from a smoother navigation experience with the scroll functionality automatically directing them to the footer for easier access to essential information. Additionally, the button click timeout has been extended, allowing users more time to interact with buttons before timing out. The backoff mechanism has also been enhanced to provide better handling of errors and retries, ensuring a more robust and reliable performance. These enhancements aim to streamline user interactions and improve overall usability within the Heureka component.
