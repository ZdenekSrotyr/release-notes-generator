Title:
Improved Data Response Handling and Formatting in Component-Franconnect

Excerpt:
Enhanced error handling for responses and improved data formatting for better user experience.

Post Detail:
In this update from version 0.0.4 to 0.0.5 of the component-franconnect repository, significant improvements have been made to the way data responses are handled. Previously, there was an issue where responses could be in the form of a dictionary instead of a list of dictionaries, leading to errors. This has been fixed to ensure that exceptions are raised correctly when needed. Additionally, line lengths have been optimized for better readability and overall user experience. These changes aim to enhance the functionality and reliability of the component, providing users with a smoother data processing experience.

- fix response can be dict instead of list of dict, properly raising exception 




- Fix line length
