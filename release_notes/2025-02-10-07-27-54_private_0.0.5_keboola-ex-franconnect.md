## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Response Handling Update

Excerpt: Enhanced versatility in data processing with the ability to handle single dictionary responses.

Post detail: In this release, the way the response is handled has been modified. Previously, the system expected the response to be a list of dictionaries. With this update, the response can also be a dictionary. This change, which likely resides in the main processing or API interaction files, allows for more varied types of data to be processed, potentially reducing errors from unexpected input formats. No other changes affecting data processing, output, error handling, configuration options, or component behavior have been reported.



## Changes:



- fix response can be dict instead of list of dict, properly raising exception 




- Fix line length 




- PR #2
