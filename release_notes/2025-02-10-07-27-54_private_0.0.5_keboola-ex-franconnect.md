## FranConnect Component Update: Improved Reliability and Error Handling
The FranConnect component is now more robust, handling single-item API responses correctly and offering more descriptive error feedback.

We've released an update for the FranConnect component to improve its data processing capabilities and error reporting.

This update addresses scenarios where the FranConnect API might return a single record as a direct dictionary object, rather than the expected list containing a single dictionary. The component now automatically handles this case by wrapping the single object into a list, ensuring consistent processing and preventing potential errors or data loss for these specific API responses.

Additionally, we've refined the component's error handling. When an API request fails, the component will now attempt to extract more specific error details (like `errorDescription`) directly from the API's JSON response. This provides clearer, more actionable error messages for easier troubleshooting, falling back to the raw response text if specific details aren't available. These enhancements make the FranConnect component more reliable and user-friendly.



## Changes:



- fix response can be dict instead of list of dict, properly raising exception 




- Fix line length 




- PR #2
