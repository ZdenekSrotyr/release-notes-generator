## Change log (AI generated):
## FranConnect Component Update: Reliable Single Record Ingestion
Ensures consistent data ingestion by correctly handling single-object API responses in the FranConnect component.

We've updated the FranConnect component to better handle API responses. Previously, if an API endpoint returned only a single matching record as a dictionary object (instead of a list containing that single dictionary), it could cause processing errors downstream for steps expecting a list of records.

This update modifies the response processing logic (`_process_response` method) to automatically wrap such single dictionary responses into a list. This ensures that even when only one record is returned by the FranConnect API, it is correctly processed and ingested into your tables, preventing data loss and ensuring pipeline stability.

## FranConnect Update: Enhanced Error Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting FranConnect API errors is now easier with more detailed information included in error messages.

We've improved the error handling within the FranConnect component. When an HTTP error occurs during an API request (e.g., a 4xx or 5xx status code), the component now includes the body of the API response within the logged error message and the raised `UserException`.

This enhancement provides significantly more context when an API call fails, making it easier and faster to diagnose the root cause of the issue, whether it's related to the request parameters, authentication, or an issue on the FranConnect API side. This change does not affect the processing logic for successful API requests.

- fix response can be dict instead of list of dict, properly raising exception 




- Fix line length
