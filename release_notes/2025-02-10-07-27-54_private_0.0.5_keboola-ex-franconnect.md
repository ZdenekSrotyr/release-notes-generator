Title: FranConnect Extractor: Enhanced API Response Handling
Excerpt: Improved reliability and clearer error reporting for the FranConnect extractor's API interactions.
Post Detail:
We've rolled out enhancements to how the FranConnect extractor handles API responses, boosting both reliability and error clarity.

The extractor now correctly processes API responses containing a single record (JSON object) by automatically wrapping it into a list. This ensures a consistent list format for downstream processing, preventing errors when the API returns only one result instead of the usual list.

Additionally, API error message handling has been improved. The extractor now explicitly checks responses for specific error messages like 'Invalid Token' or 'Invalid API Key', raising clearer exceptions (`UserException`) for faster identification and troubleshooting of API-side issues.



## Changes:



- fix response can be dict instead of list of dict, properly raising exception 




- Fix line length 




- PR #2
