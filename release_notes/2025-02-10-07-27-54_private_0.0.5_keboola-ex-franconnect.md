## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Update: Enhanced API Response Handling and Error Messages
Components now reliably process single-record API responses and provide more specific error feedback from APIs.

We have implemented enhancements to improve the reliability and error reporting of component interactions with APIs.

Components processing API responses now consistently handle cases where the API returns a single record (dictionary) instead of a list. The code in `src/component.py` now automatically wraps such single-record responses into a list, ensuring uniform data processing and preventing potential errors when only one item is returned by the API.

Additionally, error handling within `src/component.py` has been refined. Components now specifically check for `"isSuccessful": False` flags within API responses. If this flag indicates a failure, a `UserException` is raised, presenting the specific error message provided by the API directly to the user for clearer troubleshooting.

Minor code formatting changes were also included but do not affect component functionality.



## Changes:



- fix response can be dict instead of list of dict, properly raising exception 




- Fix line length 




- PR #2
