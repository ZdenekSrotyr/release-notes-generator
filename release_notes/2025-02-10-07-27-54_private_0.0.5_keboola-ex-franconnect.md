## Change log (AI generated):
## Franconnect Extractor: Improved Handling of Single Record Results
The Franconnect extractor now reliably processes API endpoints that return single records, ensuring consistent data ingestion.

We have enhanced the Franconnect extractor to better handle API responses. Previously, if an endpoint returned a single data record as a dictionary instead of a list containing that dictionary, it could lead to processing issues. The extractor now automatically wraps such single-record dictionary responses in a list, ensuring consistent data structure for ingestion and preventing potential errors or data loss.

Additionally, we've applied a similar improvement to error handling. If the Franconnect API returns an error message as a single dictionary, the extractor now wraps it in a list. This ensures consistent error message formatting and reporting, making troubleshooting more straightforward. Minor code formatting changes were also included, which have no impact on functionality.



## Changes:



- fix response can be dict instead of list of dict, properly raising exception 




- Fix line length 




- PR #2
