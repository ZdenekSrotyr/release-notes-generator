## Franconnect Extractor Update: Consistent Data Handling and Error Reporting
This update ensures consistent list structure from Franconnect API responses and improves error handling for more reliable data extraction.

We've updated the Franconnect extractor to enhance its robustness and reliability when processing data from the API.

Previously, the component could encounter issues if the Franconnect API returned a single record as a simple object instead of a list containing that single object. This inconsistency could disrupt data processing. The extractor now automatically detects this scenario and wraps single-object responses into a list, ensuring a consistent data structure is always passed to the next processing step, such as writing to a CSV file. This prevents unexpected errors and ensures smoother data loading, regardless of the number of records returned by the API.

Additionally, we've improved how the component handles invalid JSON responses. If the API returns malformed data, the extractor will now raise a clearer `UserException`, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot issues originating from the API endpoint itself. This leads to better error reporting and faster resolution times when problems occur.



## Changes:



- fix response can be dict instead of list of dict, properly raising exception 




- Fix line length 




- PR #2
