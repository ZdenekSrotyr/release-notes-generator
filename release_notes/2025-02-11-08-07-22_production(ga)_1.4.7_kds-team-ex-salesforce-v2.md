## Change log (AI generated):
## Salesforce Extractor: Smarter Schema Handling for Objects & Queries
The Salesforce Extractor now automatically detects data types for object extractions and standardizes schema for custom queries, improving data accuracy and consistency.

We've updated the Salesforce Extractor to enhance how it handles data types for your extracted tables in Keboola Connection.

For full object extractions (`query_type: objects`), the component now intelligently queries Salesforce metadata to determine the appropriate data type for each field. It maps Salesforce types like boolean, date, double, int, and string directly to Keboola base types (BOOLEAN, DATE, DOUBLE, INTEGER, STRING). This means your output tables will now have more accurate and specific column types, better reflecting the source data structure, instead of potentially defaulting many columns to STRING.

For custom SOQL queries (`query_type: query`), we've standardized the output schema. The component will now consistently define all columns in the output table manifest as STRING. This ensures predictable and uniform table structures for all your custom queries, simplifying downstream processing, although it means specific type information (like numeric or date) from the query results won't be automatically reflected in the destination table schema.



## Changes:



- generate schema with dtypes for objects, use STRING for custom queries 




- ruff format 




- flake8 




- fix default schema
