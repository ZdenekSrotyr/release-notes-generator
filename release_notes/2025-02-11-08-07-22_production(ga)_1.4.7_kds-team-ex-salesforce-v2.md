## Salesforce Extractor: Accurate Schema Generation Based on Metadata

The Salesforce extractor now generates table schemas using Salesforce metadata for standard objects and provides distinct handling for custom SOQL queries.

We've updated how the Salesforce extractor handles schema generation to improve accuracy and consistency. For standard Salesforce objects, the component now fetches object metadata directly using the Salesforce API (`describe_object`). It maps Salesforce data types (like string, double, boolean, date, datetime, int) to their corresponding Keboola Storage types (STRING, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, DATE, TIMESTAMP, INTEGER). Unmappable Salesforce types default to STRING. This results in output tables with data types that more accurately reflect the source definition in Salesforce.

When extracting data using custom SOQL queries (where the `query_type` parameter is set to 'soql'), the component now generates a schema where all columns are assigned the STRING data type. This ensures consistent output for custom queries, though specific Salesforce type information is not preserved in the Keboola table definition for this mode.

Additionally, the previous method of inferring schema types from the first batch of data has been removed. Schema generation now relies solely on either the Salesforce metadata for standard objects or the STRING default for custom SOQL queries, making the process independent of data content and more predictable. The introduction of the `query_type` configuration parameter ensures the correct schema generation logic is applied based on your extraction method.
