## Change log (AI generated):
## Salesforce Extractor Now Infers Data Types
Our Salesforce Extractor now automatically maps Salesforce field types to specific Keboola data types for object extractions.

The Salesforce Extractor has been enhanced to improve data type handling for standard object extractions. Previously, columns might have defaulted to generic types.
Now, the extractor utilizes the Salesforce `describe` API to fetch metadata, including field data types. This information is used to generate a manifest file (`.csv.manifest`) for each output table, mapping Salesforce types like `datetime`, `date`, `double`, `boolean`, and `int` to corresponding Keboola base types (`TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`, `DECIMAL`, `BOOLEAN`, `INTEGER`). Unrecognized types default to `STRING`.
This change results in more accurate data type definitions in your Keboola Storage tables, improving compatibility and usability for downstream transformations and applications. Note that the actual data values extracted remain unchanged; only the associated metadata defining the column types is affected.

## Consistent STRING Typing for Salesforce Custom Queries
Columns extracted using custom SOQL queries in the Salesforce Extractor now consistently default to the STRING data type.

We've updated the Salesforce Extractor to ensure predictable data typing when using custom SOQL queries.
For any extraction configured with a custom query, the component now automatically generates a manifest file (`.csv.manifest`) where all columns are explicitly assigned the `STRING` Keboola base type. This provides consistent metadata for tables generated from custom queries, simplifying downstream processing as you can reliably expect string data types.
The underlying data values extracted from Salesforce via your custom SOQL query remain unchanged by this update.



## Changes:



- generate schema with dtypes for objects, use STRING for custom queries 




- ruff format 




- flake8 




- fix default schema 




- fix query type 




- fix name 




- Merged in feature/native-types (pull request #48)
