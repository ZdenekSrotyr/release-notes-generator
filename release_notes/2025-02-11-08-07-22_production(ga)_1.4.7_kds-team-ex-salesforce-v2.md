## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Data Typing in Salesforce Extractor
The Salesforce extractor now provides more accurate data types for object extractions and consistent STRING types for custom SOQL queries.

We've updated the Salesforce extractor to improve how data types are handled, leading to better data quality and consistency in your Keboola tables.

For standard Salesforce object extractions, the component now intelligently uses Salesforce metadata (`describe()`) to determine the most appropriate data type for each column. Salesforce types like `int`, `double`, `date`, `datetime`, and `boolean` are now accurately mapped to corresponding Keboola Base types (`INTEGER`, `NUMERIC`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`, `BOOLEAN`). This means your output tables will have more specific and accurate data types automatically applied. Columns with unknown Salesforce types will default to `STRING`.

For custom SOQL queries, we've standardized the output schema. All columns returned by your custom SOQL queries will now be explicitly typed as `STRING` in the output table definition. If your query includes the `Id` column, it will automatically be set as the primary key. This ensures a consistent structure for SOQL results, although you may need to perform type casting downstream if specific numeric or date types are required.

These enhancements aim to provide more reliable and predictable data structures from your Salesforce extractions.
