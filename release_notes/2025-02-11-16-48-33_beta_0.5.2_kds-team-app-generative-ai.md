## Change log (AI generated):
Title: OpenAI Service Configuration Refined

Excerpt: Fixed a minor inconsistency in the default setting for the OpenAI service parameter.

Post detail:
We've updated the configuration schema for components utilizing OpenAI services. Specifically, the default value specified for the `service` parameter in the `configSchema.json` file has been corrected.

The internal `enum` value representing the OpenAI service was changed from `"OpenAI"` to `"openai"` to match its corresponding display name. This adjustment ensures consistency in how the default service selection is stored and validated during component configuration. This refinement affects the configuration validation and potentially the default value presented or saved, but does not alter the component's data processing logic.



## Changes:



- Fix the default value for "OpenAI" key within service within service enum value in config 




- Merged in fix-default-openai-config-value (pull request #18)
