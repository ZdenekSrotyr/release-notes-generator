_Released on 2025-02-11_

**Component:** [kds-team.app-generative-ai](https://github.com/keboola/component-generative-ai)  
**Tag:** [0.5.2](https://github.com/keboola/component-generative-ai/releases/tag/0.5.2)  
**Stage:** BETA


## Change log (AI generated):
## Configuration Schema Correction

We've corrected the OpenAI service identifier in the configuration schema for improved consistency and validation.

We have implemented a minor correction within the configuration schema file (`configSchema.json`). The allowed enum value representing the OpenAI service has been updated from "OpenAI" to "openai".

This change ensures the schema definition matches the default value, improving overall configuration consistency and validation accuracy. This is purely a schema definition update and does not alter how the component processes data for different services; existing functionality remains unchanged.



## Changes:



- Fix the default value for "OpenAI" key within service within service enum value in config 




- Merged in fix-default-openai-config-value (pull request #18)
