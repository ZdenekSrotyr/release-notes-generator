_Released on 2025-02-11_

**Component:** [kds-team.app-generative-ai](https://github.com/keboola/component-generative-ai)  
**Tag:** [0.5.2](https://github.com/keboola/component-generative-ai/releases/tag/0.5.2)  
**Stage:** BETA


## Change log (AI generated):
## Default AI Service Parameter Adjusted to "OpenAI"
We've updated the default AI service setting from "openai" to "OpenAI" in relevant component configurations.

This update involves a change to the configuration schema (`configSchema.json`) for components utilizing AI services. Specifically, the default value for the `service` parameter has been changed from `"openai"` to `"OpenAI"`.

If you rely on the default setting for the AI service provider in your component configuration, the default will now resolve to "OpenAI" instead of "openai". This change standardizes the naming convention but does not alter the underlying processing logic of the component itself. Configurations where the service is explicitly defined remain unaffected.



## Changes:



- Fix the default value for "OpenAI" key within service within service enum value in config 




- Merged in fix-default-openai-config-value (pull request #18)
