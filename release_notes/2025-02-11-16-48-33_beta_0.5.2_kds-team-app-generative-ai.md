## Change log (AI generated):
## Configuration Schema Update for OpenAI Service
We've updated the configuration schema, correcting the default value for the OpenAI service option.

This update addresses a minor inconsistency within the component's configuration schema (`configSchema.json`).
The default value displayed for the OpenAI service option has been corrected from `"OpenAI"` to `"openai"`.
This change only impacts the schema definition itself and ensures better consistency. It does not alter the component's core data processing functionality or how it interacts with the OpenAI service, as the internal logic already uses the correct `"openai"` identifier. Your existing configurations and data processing remain unaffected by this schema update.



## Changes:



- Fix the default value for "OpenAI" key within service within service enum value in config 




- Merged in fix-default-openai-config-value (pull request #18)
