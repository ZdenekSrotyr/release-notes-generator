## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Addition of Multi-Metadata Support

Excerpt: Changes to metadata processing and storage.

Post Detail: The latest release includes the addition of support for multiple metadata, potentially altering the way metadata is processed or stored. A change from using a hash to a username has been implemented, which may impact user identification or authentication. No data changes were identified in this release. 

Several attempts were made to optimize the Dockerfile and artifact upload process, but these changes were later reverted and do not affect data processing. The Dockerfile and GitHub workflow have been modified, which could potentially impact the build and deployment process of the application. 

Additionally, adjustments have been made to adhere to Flake8, a Python code linter, for code quality checks. No impact on data processing is expected from these changes. 

Finally, a commit suggests the addition of more metadata columns, potentially changing the data structure. More detailed analysis cannot be provided without access to specific code changes.
