## Change log (AI generated):
## FranConnect Component Authentication Update
We have updated the authentication URL for the FranConnect component to ensure continued connectivity.

We've implemented an important technical update to the FranConnect component. Specifically, the authentication URL used to obtain OAuth tokens has been changed.

This update ensures the component can successfully authenticate with the FranConnect API, which is necessary for any data extraction. The core logic for processing data (fetching specific fields, transformations, filtering) remains unchanged. This change simply maintains the component's ability to connect and function correctly.
