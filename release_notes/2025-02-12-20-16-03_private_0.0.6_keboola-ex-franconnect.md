## Change log (AI generated):
## FranConnect Component Authentication Update
FranConnect component's authentication URL has been updated to ensure seamless connectivity.

We have updated the authentication mechanism for our FranConnect component. This involves changing the specific URL used by the component to connect and authenticate with the FranConnect API, ensuring continued reliable connections.

This technical update solely addresses the authentication process. It does not alter how data is retrieved or processed by the component after a successful connection is made. No action is required on your part, as your existing FranConnect configurations remain unaffected.
