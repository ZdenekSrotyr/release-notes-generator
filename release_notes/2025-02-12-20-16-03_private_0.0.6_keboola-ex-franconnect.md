## FranConnect Component: Authentication Update
We've updated the authentication endpoint for the FranConnect component to ensure seamless connectivity.

We have updated the FranConnect component to use the correct authentication URL required by the FranConnect API. This change ensures that the component can successfully authenticate and establish a connection.

This update is crucial for maintaining reliable data extraction from FranConnect. While this change happens behind the scenes and doesn't alter the structure or content of the data you retrieve, it ensures the component continues to function correctly by using the proper endpoint for authentication credentials. No action is required on your part.
