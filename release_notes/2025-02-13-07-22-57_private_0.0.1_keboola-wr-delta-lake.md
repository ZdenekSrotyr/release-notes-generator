## Change log (AI generated):
Introducing the Delta Lake Writer

Easily write your Keboola table data into the Delta Lake format.

We are excited to announce the release of the new Delta Lake Writer component. This component enables you to seamlessly ingest data from your input tables (in CSV format) and store it efficiently in the open-source Delta Lake format.

Designed for performance and large datasets, the writer processes input files in chunks, significantly reducing memory requirements and preventing potential out-of-memory issues. It converts data through Apache Arrow for compatibility with the Delta Lake library.

Key configuration options allow you to tailor the writing process:
*   Control how data is added using `write_mode` ('append' or 'overwrite').
*   Optimize query performance by defining table partitioning with `partition_by`.
*   Manage schema evolution using `overwrite_schema` and `schema_merge` parameters.
*   Fine-tune the underlying Parquet file output (e.g., compression) via `writer_properties`.

This component provides a robust and configurable way to integrate Keboola data pipelines with Delta Lake storage.
