## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Writer: Batch Processing & Advanced Options
Write large datasets efficiently to Delta Lake with new batch processing and configure partitioning, schema handling, and table properties.

The Delta Lake Writer component now processes large input CSV files more efficiently using batch processing. Data is read and written in chunks, significantly reducing memory usage and preventing errors with large datasets. The first batch establishes the table according to your settings, while subsequent batches are appended with schema merging enabled.

Gain more control over your Delta tables with new configuration parameters. You can now explicitly set `overwrite_schema` for the initial write, manage schema evolution using `merge_schema` (default is true), define `partition_by` columns for optimized querying, and set custom `writer_properties` for your Delta tables.

Additionally, the component now supports processing multiple input tables defined in the Keboola UI and gracefully handles empty input files by skipping them.
