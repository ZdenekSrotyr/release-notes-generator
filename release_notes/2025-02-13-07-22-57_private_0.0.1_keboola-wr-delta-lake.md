## Change log (AI generated):
## Control Your Delta Lake Writes: New Configuration Options
New options allow fine-grained control over how data is written to Delta Lake tables.

We've enhanced our Delta Lake writing capabilities by introducing configuration options for writer properties. You can now specify parameters such as the write mode (e.g., `append`, `overwrite`), add a table description, and control schema overwrite behavior directly within the component configuration.

This update gives you more precise control over your data loading processes into Delta Lake. Easily manage how new data interacts with existing table data and schemas, ensuring your Delta tables are structured and updated exactly as needed.

## Enhanced Large File Support: Delta Lake Writer Now Uses Batch Processing
Process larger datasets more efficiently with the introduction of batch processing for Delta Lake writes.

To improve performance and stability when handling large datasets, the component now processes input files in batches when writing to Delta Lake. Instead of attempting to load and process the entire file at once, data is read and written incrementally.

This change significantly reduces memory consumption during execution, preventing potential out-of-memory issues and enabling the processing of files that might exceed available system memory. Your data is written completely and accurately to the Delta table, now with enhanced efficiency for larger volumes.
