## Enhanced Delta Lake Writer: Batch Processing & Advanced Configuration
Our Delta Lake writer component now processes data in batches for improved performance with large datasets and offers enhanced configuration for write modes, partitioning, and specific Delta Lake writer properties.

We've upgraded our component responsible for writing data to Delta Lake, introducing significant improvements for performance and customization.

Key enhancements include:
*   **Improved Performance for Large Files:** Data is now processed incrementally in batches instead of loading the entire input file into memory. This significantly reduces memory consumption, making it more robust and efficient when handling large datasets.
*   **Flexible Write Modes:** You can now explicitly configure the write `mode` as either 'overwrite' to replace the existing table data or 'append' to add new data.
*   **Configurable Partitioning:** Optimize query performance and data organization by specifying columns for partitioning using the `partition_by` parameter directly in the configuration.
*   **Advanced Delta Lake Tuning:** Gain finer control over your Delta tables by passing specific `writer_properties`. This allows you to customize physical characteristics like compression type or metadata settings like statistics collection levels.
*   **Expanded Filesystem Support:** The component now automatically configures the necessary filesystem client (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage, Local) based on your target Delta table path and provided credentials, offering greater flexibility in where you store your Delta tables.

These updates provide more control over how your data is written and structured in Delta Lake, while also improving the stability and performance of the writing process, especially for larger volumes of data.
