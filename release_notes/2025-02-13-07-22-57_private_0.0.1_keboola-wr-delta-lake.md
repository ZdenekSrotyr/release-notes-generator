## Azure Delta Lake Writer: Introducing Merge, Incremental Loads, and Optimizations
The Azure Delta Lake Writer component gains powerful new features including merge (upsert) functionality, optimized handling of large files, and improved incremental loading.

We've significantly updated the Azure Delta Lake Writer component, introducing powerful features for more flexible and efficient data loading into Azure Delta Lake.

Key enhancements include:

*   **Merge (Upsert) Capability:** Perform incremental updates with the new `merge` write mode. Define `primary_keys` and optionally provide a custom SQL `merge_condition` to update existing rows and insert new ones based on key matching. If no condition is provided, it defaults to matching all primary keys.
*   **Clear Load Types:** The new `load_type` parameter distinguishes between `'full'` load (overwrites table and schema) and `'incremental'` load (uses `append` or `merge` write modes).
*   **Schema Evolution for Appends:** Incremental loads using `append` mode now automatically merge schemas, allowing you to add new columns to your target table without manual intervention or job failure.
*   **Optimized Large File Handling:** Input CSVs are now processed in memory-efficient batches, improving reliability when working with large datasets.
*   **Primary Key Null Filtering:** To ensure reliable merge operations, rows containing null values in any specified primary key column are automatically filtered out before writing.
*   **Advanced Configuration:** Utilize the `writer_properties` parameter to pass specific settings directly to the Delta Lake writer for fine-grained control over performance and storage.

These updates provide greater control over your data loading strategies, improve performance, and enhance the robustness of writing data to Azure Delta Lake.
