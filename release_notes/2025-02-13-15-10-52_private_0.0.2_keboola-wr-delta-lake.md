## Change log (AI generated):
## Optimize Delta Lake Performance with Table Partitioning
The Delta Lake Writer component now allows you to partition tables for significantly faster query performance.

We've enhanced the Delta Lake Writer component to support table partitioning. This new capability allows you to structure your Delta tables based on the values in specified columns, physically organizing the data on storage.

Partitioning can lead to substantial improvements in query speed, especially when filtering or aggregating data based on the partition columns. By pruning unnecessary data scans, Keboola can access the relevant information much more efficiently.

To utilize this feature, simply specify the desired column names in the new optional `partition_by` setting within the table configuration options for the Delta Lake Writer. This enables better data organization and optimized performance for your downstream analytics and reporting tasks.
