## Change log (AI generated):
## Partition Your Delta Lake Tables for Faster Queries
Boost query performance by partitioning your Delta Lake output tables using specified columns.

You can now partition the output Delta Lake table by specific columns. This is managed through a new optional `partition_by` parameter in the component configuration, where you specify an array of column names. The component configuration schema has been updated to include this new setting.

Partitioning organizes the data into separate directories based on the values in the chosen columns. This changes the physical data layout in storage and can significantly improve query performance when filtering by the partitioning columns.
