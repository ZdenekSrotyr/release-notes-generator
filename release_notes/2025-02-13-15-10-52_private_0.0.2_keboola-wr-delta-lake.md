## Change log (AI generated):
## Introducing Partitioning for Delta Lake Tables
Enhance Delta Lake query performance by partitioning your output tables based on specified column values.

We're excited to announce a new capability for writing data to Delta Lake: table partitioning. This feature allows you to physically organize your Delta Lake table data on storage based on the values in specific columns, which can significantly improve query performance, especially for large datasets.

To use this feature, simply specify the columns you want to partition by using the new `partitionBy` parameter in your component configuration. Keboola will then automatically structure the output data directories according to the values in these columns. While this changes how your data is stored and organized, the actual content of your data remains the same. This optimized storage layout enables query engines to efficiently prune data, reading only the relevant partitions and speeding up queries that filter on the partitioned columns.
