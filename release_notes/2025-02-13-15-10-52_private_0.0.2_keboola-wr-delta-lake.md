## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Delta Lake Writer: Partitioning & Incremental Updates

**Excerpt:** Enhance your Delta Lake tables with partitioning and incremental loading capabilities.

**Post detail:**
The Delta Lake Writer component now supports partitioning. You can specify columns in the configuration using `partition_by`, and the writer will physically organize the table data into subdirectories based on the values in these columns. This improves query performance by enabling partition pruning during reads. Configuration validation now checks if specified partitioning columns exist in the source table.

We've also introduced incremental loading. By setting the `incremental` configuration flag, you can now operate in 'append' mode, adding new rows to your existing Delta table instead of replacing the entire table content with each run. The default behavior remains 'overwrite' if the flag is not set or is false.

Under the hood, interactions with Delta Lake and the handling of its transaction log (`_delta_log`) have been refactored for better structure and compliance with the Delta Lake protocol. As part of this standardization, the component no longer writes custom manifest files, relying solely on the standard Delta Lake metadata.
