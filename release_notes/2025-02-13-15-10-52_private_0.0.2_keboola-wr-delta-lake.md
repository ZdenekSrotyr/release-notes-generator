## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Component Now Supports Table Partitioning
Partition your output Delta Lake tables by specific columns using the latest component update.

We've enhanced the Delta Lake component (`keboola/component-delta-lake`) to include support for table partitioning, a key feature for optimizing data layout and query performance.

You can now configure the component to partition the output Delta table based on the values in one or more columns from your input data. Partitioning physically organizes your data into separate directories based on these column values. This structuring can significantly speed up queries that filter on the partitioning columns, especially when working with large datasets, leading to faster insights and reduced processing costs.

To enable this, simply specify the desired column names in the new `partition_by` parameter within the component configuration. We have also added validation to check that the specified partitioning columns exist in your input data before writing, preventing potential errors and ensuring your configuration is correct.
