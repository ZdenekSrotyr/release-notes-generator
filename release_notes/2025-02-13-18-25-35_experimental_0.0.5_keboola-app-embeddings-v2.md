**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.5](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.5)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Generate & Store Embeddings with New Component
Our new Embeddings Generator component lets you create text embeddings using OpenAI and store them directly in Pinecone vector databases.

Unlock the power of vector embeddings for your AI projects with our new Embeddings Generator component. This component simplifies the process of transforming textual data from your Keboola tables into meaningful vector representations using state-of-the-art OpenAI models.

Easily configure the component to select specific columns for embedding generation. You can also include data from other columns as metadata alongside the vectors when storing them in your Pinecone vector database, enriching the context for your downstream applications.

Key features include optimized batch processing for performance, the ability to handle large text fields within your input data, and reliable data transfer to Pinecone. We've also added an upsert capability, allowing you to insert new vectors or update existing ones based on their ID, keeping your vector store synchronized with your source data.

Start leveraging your Keboola data for advanced AI tasks today!
