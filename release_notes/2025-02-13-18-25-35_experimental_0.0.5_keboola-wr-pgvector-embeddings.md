#  keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings 0.0.5

_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.5](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.5)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Generate Vector Embeddings Directly from Your Tables

Easily create vector embeddings from your Keboola table data using our new component, integrating directly with vector databases.

We're excited to introduce the **Vector Embeddings Job** component, designed to streamline the process of transforming your structured data into powerful vector representations for AI applications. This new component bridges the gap between your data stored in Keboola tables and the world of vector databases.

Simply configure the component to read from your input table, specify which columns contain the text you want to embed, and optionally select other columns to include as metadata. The component efficiently processes your data in batches, generates embeddings using sentence-transformer models, and upserts the resulting vectors along with their associated metadata into your chosen vector database, starting with support for Pinecone.

Key features include:
*   **Flexible Configuration:** Choose exactly which columns to embed and which to use as metadata.
*   **Efficient Processing:** Optimized batching reduces API calls and speeds up processing, capable of handling large text fields.
*   **Metadata Inclusion:** Enrich your vectors with valuable context from other table columns.
*   **Traceability:** An output table is generated in Keboola Storage, logging the identifiers of processed rows.

This component significantly simplifies preparing your data for tasks like semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), classification, and clustering directly within your Keboola workflows.
