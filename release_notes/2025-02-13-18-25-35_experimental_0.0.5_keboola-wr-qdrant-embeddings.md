**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component Enhanced: Add Metadata, Boost Performance
Our Embeddings component now processes data faster with batching and enriches vectors with metadata from your source tables.

We've rolled out significant updates to the Embeddings v2 component (up to version 0.0.5), enhancing its capabilities for generating and managing vector embeddings. These improvements focus on flexibility, performance, and reliability when working with your text data.

Key Enhancements Include:

*   **Metadata Enrichment:** You can now include specified metadata columns from your input table directly alongside the generated vectors in your Pinecone database. This enriches your vectors with valuable context, improving search relevance and analysis.
*   **Performance Boost:** We've implemented and optimized batch processing for both generating embeddings via the OpenAI API and writing data to the Pinecone vector database. This significantly speeds up processing, especially for larger datasets.
*   **Improved Vector Updates:** The component now uses an `upsert` operation when writing to Pinecone. This allows you to easily update existing vectors based on their ID, streamlining data synchronization workflows.
*   **Handle Large Texts:** We've increased the processing limits to better handle input tables containing very large text fields, preventing errors and ensuring more robust data handling.
*   **Enhanced Output:** The structure of the output CSV table (`embeddings.csv`) has been refined to provide a clear record of the generated embeddings and source data.

These updates make the Embeddings component a more powerful and efficient tool for transforming your text data into searchable, context-rich vector embeddings.
