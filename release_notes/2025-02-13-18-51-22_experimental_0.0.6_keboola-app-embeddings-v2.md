## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Embeddings: PGVector Support, Metadata, and Upsert Mode
Generate embeddings from table data and store them in Pinecone or PGVector, now with enhanced metadata handling and an upsert option.

We have released enhancements to our embedding generation capabilities, allowing you to easily transform text data from your Keboola tables into vector embeddings and store them in a vector database. This component reads a specified column from an input table, generates embeddings using a chosen model, and writes the results.

Initially supporting Pinecone, you can now choose PostgreSQL with the PGVector extension as your vector database destination. This provides greater flexibility in where you store and manage your embeddings based on your existing infrastructure or preferences.

Enrich your vectors by including relevant metadata directly from your source data. You can configure the component to extract data from one or multiple specified columns in your input table and store it alongside the corresponding vectors in Pinecone or PGVector, providing valuable context for your downstream applications.

Manage your vector data lifecycle more effectively with the new 'upsert' action. When configuring the component, you can choose 'insert' to append new vectors or select 'upsert' to delete all existing data in the target index or table before inserting the new vectors, allowing for complete data replacement.

Additionally, performance and robustness have been improved through optimized batch processing logic for embedding generation, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets. The component can now also process input tables with very large text fields thanks to an increased field size limit, and includes refinements to credential handling and metadata formatting for improved reliability.
