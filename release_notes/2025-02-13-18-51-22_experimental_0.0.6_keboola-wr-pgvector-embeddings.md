## PostgreSQL Component Update: Schema Support, Timestamps & Smarter Keys
Enhance your PostgreSQL data loading with schema organization, automatic update timestamps, and content-based primary keys for reliable upserts.

We've rolled out significant improvements to our PostgreSQL component, designed to give you more control and insight into your data loading processes.

Organize your data more effectively with newly added PostgreSQL Schema Support. Simply specify a target schema in the configuration; the component will use it, create it if necessary, and ensure your tables land exactly where you intend them to within your database. This changes the database connection's `search_path` for targeted operations.

Keep track of data freshness automatically. A new `_timestamp` column (type `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`) is now added to the destination table. It records when each row was initially inserted and automatically updates whenever a row is modified due to a data conflict, giving you clear visibility into data updates.

Ensure data integrity and reliable updates with Explicit Primary Key Calculation. The component now calculates a unique primary key (`_pk`) for each row based on the SHA256 hash of your designated input text columns. This content-based key is used directly in database operations, enabling accurate `ON CONFLICT` behavior to update existing records based on their content, preventing unintended duplicates and ensuring smoother data synchronization.
