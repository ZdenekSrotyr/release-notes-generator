## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component Updates: Metadata, Upserts, and Large Field Support
The Text Embeddings component introduces metadata integration, vector database upserts, improved large text handling, and specific integration fixes.

Recent updates to the `keboola/component-embeddings-v2` component (up to version 0.0.6) enhance its functionality and reliability for generating text embeddings.

Key improvements include the ability to include multiple metadata columns from your input table alongside the generated vectors when writing to a vector database destination. This enriches the output with relevant context from the source data. Additionally, the component now supports an `upsert` capability for vector databases, allowing records to be updated if they already exist based on their ID, rather than only inserting new records.

Handling of input data has also been improved. A fix ensures the correct input column specified for embedding is reliably selected. Furthermore, the component now accommodates larger text fields by increasing the internal field size limit, preventing errors when processing rows with extensive text content. Performance has been addressed through optimizations in batch processing when interacting with embedding models and vector databases.

Finally, specific fixes have been implemented to improve the reliability of integration with Pinecone as a vector database destination, and configuration handling has been refined for better stability.
