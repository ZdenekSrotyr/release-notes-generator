## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component Update: Enhanced Vector DB Support & Reliability
Updates to the Embeddings component improve vector database integration with metadata and upsert support, alongside crucial fixes for data handling and processing stability.

Our Embeddings component, which generates vector representations of your text data using models like OpenAI or Sentence Transformers, has received several updates focused on reliability and functionality, particularly when working with vector databases.

Integration with vector databases such as Pinecone and PGVector has been enhanced. We've improved how data is formatted and sent, specifically refining interactions with Pinecone. You can now include specified metadata columns from your source table alongside the generated vectors when writing to these databases, providing more context to your embeddings. The component now also performs "upsert" operations based on a row ID, meaning it will update existing vectors or insert new ones, preventing duplicates for the same ID.

Data handling throughout the process is now more robust. We've corrected the logic for selecting the specified input text column and fixed issues related to writing results to output CSV tables. To prevent errors with large text content, the component now supports larger field sizes when reading input CSV files. Additionally, fixes ensure that the component correctly uses the specified destination, whether it's an output table name or a vector database index/collection name. Batch processing has also been optimized for better efficiency when interacting with embedding models and databases.
