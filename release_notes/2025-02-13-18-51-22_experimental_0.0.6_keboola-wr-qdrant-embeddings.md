_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.6](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.6)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Generate and Store Text Embeddings with New Component V2

Generate text embeddings from your tables and store them with metadata in vector databases using our new Embeddings Component V2.

We are introducing the Embeddings Component V2, designed to streamline the process of generating and storing text embeddings. This component reads data from your input tables, identifies a designated text column, generates vector embeddings using external APIs (e.g., OpenAI), and writes the results—including an ID and the embedding—to both a vector database destination and an output CSV table. The initial version established this core batch processing workflow.

Key enhancements have been added to improve functionality and flexibility. You can now select multiple columns from your input table to be included as metadata alongside the vector in the destination database, providing richer context for your embeddings. The component now utilizes an "upsert" logic when writing to the vector database, allowing it to update existing records based on their ID or insert new ones, facilitating incremental data processing. Support for handling very large text fields in input CSVs has also been added, preventing errors with extensive text content.

Further refinements focus on reliability and correctness. Fixes have been implemented for accurate embedding column selection, efficient batch processing, correct output table generation, and proper handling of destination parameters. Interactions with vector database APIs have been improved for enhanced stability, ensuring your data is processed accurately and stored reliably.
