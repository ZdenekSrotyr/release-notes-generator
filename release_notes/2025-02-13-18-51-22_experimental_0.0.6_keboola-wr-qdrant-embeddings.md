_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.6](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.6)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## New Component: Generate Text Embeddings for Vector Databases
Introducing a new component to generate text embeddings from your tables and store them, along with metadata, in Pinecone or PGVector databases.

We have launched a new component designed for generating vector embeddings from text data in your input tables. This component utilizes sentence-transformer models to create embeddings for a specified column and writes the results, including the record ID and embedding, to your chosen vector database, supporting both Pinecone and PGVector.

Key features added since the initial version include:
*   **Metadata Inclusion:** You can now select multiple metadata columns from your input table to be stored alongside the vector embeddings in the database, providing richer context.
*   **Configurable Data Operations:** Control how data is written using the `action` parameter. Choose between `insert` (add new vectors), `upsert` (add new or update existing vectors based on ID), or `delete` (remove vectors based on ID).
*   **Enhanced Processing:** Batch processing for writing data to vector databases has been optimized for improved efficiency. The component now also handles larger text inputs more effectively due to an increased CSV field size limit.

Configuration has also been refined, including renaming the database type parameter from `destination` to `vector_store` and restructuring database-specific settings. Please review your component configurations to align with these changes.
