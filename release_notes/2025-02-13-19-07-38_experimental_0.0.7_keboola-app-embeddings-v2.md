#  keboola.app-embeddings-v2 0.0.7

_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.7](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.7)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Embed Your Text Data with New Options

Excerpt: Generate and manage text embeddings with OpenAI, including metadata storage, batch processing, and upsert functionality.

Post detail:
We've introduced functionality to process your text data and generate vector embeddings using OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model. This allows you to convert text columns from your source tables into numerical representations suitable for similarity searches and machine learning tasks. The resulting IDs and embeddings can be stored in an output table and optionally indexed in a Pinecone or PGVector database.

Several key enhancements improve this process. Processing now happens in batches, increasing speed and efficiency when interacting with the OpenAI API and vector databases. You can also select multiple columns from your source table to be stored as metadata alongside the vector in the database and included in the output table, enriching the context of each embedding. The component can now handle larger text fields from input tables, preventing errors with extensive content.

Furthermore, an `UPSERT` option has been added, allowing you to update existing entries in your vector database based on their ID, preventing duplicates and enabling data modifications. Fixes to Pinecone integration and parameter loading ensure data is reliably stored and the correct columns are used for generating embeddings.
