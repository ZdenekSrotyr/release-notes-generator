## Change log (AI generated):
## Update to pgvector Destination Parameters

We've updated how connection parameters are configured and validated for pgvector destinations.

This update modifies the handling of configuration parameters for exporting data to pgvector destinations.

Specifically, the logic for constructing the PostgreSQL connection string has been updated. The component now reads connection parameters (`driver`, `host`, `port`, `database`, `user`, `#password`) directly from the `pgvector` key within the destination configuration, adapting to a revised structure. This change, located in `exporter.py`, affects how the component establishes a connection based on user input, but does not alter the data transformation process itself.

Concurrently, the expected configuration schema defined in `component.py` has been adjusted. The `pgvector` parameter type is now defined as `dict` instead of `object`, and its associated properties and requirements have been updated accordingly. This impacts the validation and interpretation of the pgvector destination configuration provided by the user.



## Changes:
