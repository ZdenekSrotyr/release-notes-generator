**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Embeddings Component Enhanced: Batching, Metadata, PGVector & Upserts

Generate and store embeddings more efficiently with batch processing, metadata support, PGVector integration, and upsert capabilities.

The Embeddings component has received significant updates to improve performance, flexibility, and the richness of the data you can store. We've introduced batch processing for interactions with both the OpenAI API and vector databases (Pinecone and the newly supported PGVector), leading to faster generation and storage of your embeddings compared to the previous row-by-row method.

You can now enrich your vectors by including multiple metadata columns from your input table. Select the desired columns in the component configuration, and they will be stored alongside the vector and ID in your chosen vector database, providing valuable context for your embedded data.

We've expanded your storage options by adding support for PGVector, allowing you to store embeddings directly in your PostgreSQL databases alongside the existing Pinecone integration. Furthermore, a new "UPSERT" loading option is available; complementing the default "REPLACE" mode, UPSERT allows you to add new embeddings or update existing ones based on their ID, facilitating incremental updates to your vector collections.

Additionally, the component now handles larger text inputs by increasing the CSV field size limit, preventing errors with very long text fields designated for embedding. The output CSV file format has also been standardized to include `id`, `vector`, and `text` columns for better clarity.
