## Change log (AI generated):
## Unleash AI: Send Embeddings Directly to pgvector

Added support for pgvector, enabling direct storage and management of vector embeddings within your PostgreSQL databases.

Leverage the power of vector databases directly within Keboola. We have introduced native support for pgvector as a destination component. This allows you to seamlessly load text data alongside its corresponding vector embeddings into your PostgreSQL instances equipped with the pgvector extension.

The component now intelligently handles the `pgvector` destination type. When selected, it automatically manages the necessary setup, including enabling the `vector` extension in PostgreSQL if required. It also creates the target table with predefined columns for a primary key (TEXT), text data (TEXT), and embeddings (VECTOR) if the table does not already exist. Data is efficiently loaded using an upsert mechanism (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`), ensuring records are inserted or updated based on the primary key. During the upsert process, vector data is appropriately cast using the dimension derived from the first record of each data batch.



## Changes:



- Update pgvector UI 




- Update VERSION
