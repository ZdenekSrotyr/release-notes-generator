#  keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings 0.0.7

_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.7](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.7)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Embeddings Component: Metadata, Upserts, and More

Generate richer, up-to-date embeddings with enhanced vector database support, including metadata and upsert capabilities, alongside performance improvements.

Our component for generating data embeddings has received significant updates, enhancing its flexibility and robustness for your AI and machine learning workflows. These improvements focus on better integration with vector databases and more efficient data handling.

Key enhancements include:

*   **Vector Database Metadata:** Enrich your vectors by including relevant metadata columns directly from your source tables when writing to vector databases like Pinecone. This provides crucial context alongside your embeddings.
*   **Vector Database Upserts:** Keep your vector data fresh and avoid duplicates. The component now supports upsert operations, allowing you to insert new vectors or update existing ones based on row identifiers.
*   **Improved Data Handling:** We've optimized batch processing for greater efficiency and increased the component's ability to handle very large text fields in your input data, preventing errors and ensuring smoother processing.
*   **Configuration Reliability:** Fixes have been implemented to ensure the correct columns specified in `embed_columns` are used for embedding generation and that data is reliably written to your chosen destination (CSV output table or vector database).

These updates provide a more powerful and reliable way to transform your tabular data into meaningful embeddings and store them effectively for downstream applications.
