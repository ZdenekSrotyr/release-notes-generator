## Embeddings Component Gets Major Update: PGVector, Metadata & Actions
Generate and manage text embeddings more effectively with new destinations like PGVector, enhanced metadata support, and data action controls.

The Embeddings component has received significant upgrades, making it more powerful and flexible for generating, storing, and managing your text embeddings.

Key enhancements include:

*   **PGVector Destination Support:** You can now store your generated embeddings and metadata directly in PostgreSQL using the popular `pgvector` extension, providing another robust alternative alongside existing CSV file and Pinecone destinations.
*   **Vector Metadata Enrichment:** Enrich your vectors by selecting specific input columns to store as metadata in your chosen vector database (Pinecone or PGVector). This adds valuable context to your embeddings, enabling more sophisticated filtering and retrieval in downstream applications.
*   **Data Management Actions:** Gain more control over your vector data with the new `action` parameter. Choose 'upsert' (the default behavior) to add or update vectors, or select 'delete' to remove specific vectors from your Pinecone index or PGVector table based on a designated ID column in your input data.
*   **Performance and Reliability Improvements:** We've implemented batch processing for significantly faster embedding generation and vector database operations. Additionally, the component now handles very large text fields more effectively and includes fixes for accurate input column selection and destination routing, ensuring smoother and more reliable processing.

These updates provide greater flexibility, control, and performance for your text embedding workflows within Keboola.
