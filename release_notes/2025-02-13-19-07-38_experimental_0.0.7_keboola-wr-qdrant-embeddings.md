#  keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings 0.0.7

_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.7](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.7)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Generate OpenAI Embeddings and Store in Pinecone or CSV
Excerpt: Automate OpenAI embedding generation from your tables and store results in Pinecone or Keboola Storage.
Post detail:
We've introduced a new component enabling you to generate vector embeddings using the OpenAI API directly from your Keboola tables. Select a text column from your input table, and the component will calculate embeddings for each entry. Initially, you could store the resulting ID and vector pair in a Pinecone index.

Performance has been improved through batch processing for both embedding generation and data upserting. You can now enrich your vectors in Pinecone by including data from specified metadata columns from your input table. Additionally, a new destination option allows you to write the generated ID and embedding vector directly to an output CSV table within Keboola Storage. The component now also handles larger text fields more effectively by increasing the CSV field size limit.

To streamline setup and operation, distinct action modes have been implemented. Choose 'UPSERT' to perform the full embedding generation and storage process, or use 'TEST_CONNECTION' to verify connectivity with OpenAI and Pinecone without processing any data. We've also corrected issues related to input column selection and the formatting of metadata during batch upserts to Pinecone, ensuring accurate data handling.
