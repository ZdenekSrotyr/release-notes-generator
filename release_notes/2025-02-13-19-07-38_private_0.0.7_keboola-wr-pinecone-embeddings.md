## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Enhanced Text Embedding Components: Vector DBs, Metadata & Upserts

Excerpt: Store text embeddings directly in Pinecone or PGVector, enrich them with metadata, and keep them updated using upserts.

Post detail:
Our text embedding components (like OpenAI Embeddings and PGVector Embeddings) have received significant upgrades to enhance how you process and store your vectorized data. Initially focused on generating embeddings from text columns in your CSVs, these components now offer more robust destination options and data handling capabilities.

You can now directly write generated embeddings and associated data to vector databases like Pinecone and PGVector, moving beyond simple CSV outputs. Crucially, you can select multiple columns from your input table to include as metadata alongside the vectors in the database. This enriches your vectors, enabling more powerful filtering and retrieval based on your source data attributes.

To streamline data management, we've implemented an "upsert" strategy for writing to vector databases. By specifying an ID column from your input data, the component will now update existing entries or insert new ones, preventing duplicates and allowing you to easily refresh vectors based on source data changes. We've also improved reliability by increasing the ability to handle very large text fields in input CSVs and optimizing batch processing for better performance on large datasets. Fixes have been implemented to ensure the correct text column is always embedded and that data is written accurately to your chosen destination.
