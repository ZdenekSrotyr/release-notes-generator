## Change log (AI generated):
## Vectorize Your Data: Introducing the LLM Embedding Models Component
Easily create vector embeddings from your text data using OpenAI and store them with metadata in Keboola Storage or popular vector databases.

Unlock the power of your text data for AI applications with our new LLM Embedding Models component! This component simplifies the process of generating vector embeddings, a crucial step for tasks like semantic search, recommendations, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Initially launched with support for OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model, the component reads your specified text column from a Keboola Storage table and generates high-quality embeddings. You can easily configure where these embeddings are stored: back into Keboola Storage as a CSV file, or directly uploaded to popular vector databases including Pinecone, PostgreSQL (with the pgvector extension), and Qdrant.

We've packed it with flexible features to streamline your workflow. Include relevant metadata columns from your source table alongside the generated vectors in your chosen vector database. The component intelligently handles native data types (like integers, floats, and booleans) for metadata where supported, ensuring data integrity. For Pinecone users, you can choose to either insert new vectors or upsert based on ID. Behind the scenes, optimized batching ensures efficient processing and reliable data transfer.
