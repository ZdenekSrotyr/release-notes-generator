#  keboola.app-embeddings-v2 0.0.8

_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.8](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.8)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
New Qdrant Writer and Native Data Type Support

Introducing direct output to Qdrant vector databases and improved preservation of native Keboola data types.

You can now send computed embeddings and associated payload data directly to a Qdrant vector database. This new writer option simplifies indexing data for vector search applications. Configure the connection using the new `#qdrant_host`, `#qdrant_api_key`, and `qdrant_collection_name` parameters to specify your target Qdrant instance and collection.

We have also enhanced data type handling for payload columns during output writing. The component now reads the data types defined in your input tables (e.g., Integer, Decimal, Boolean) and preserves these native Keboola types in the output payload columns, rather than defaulting to strings. This improves data fidelity and consistency in your output tables and when writing to destinations like Qdrant.

Additionally, the data type definition for the output `vector` column in the table manifest has been corrected to ensure accurate schema representation for downstream processes.
