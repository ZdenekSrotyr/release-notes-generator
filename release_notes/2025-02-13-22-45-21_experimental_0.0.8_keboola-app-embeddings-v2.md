_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.8](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.8)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Embedding Component Update: Qdrant Output & Native Type Support
The embedding component now supports writing vectors directly to Qdrant vector databases and optionally uses Keboola Native Types V2.

This update introduces significant enhancements to the embedding component, providing more flexibility in handling and storing generated embeddings.

Key changes include:
*   **Qdrant Writer:** You can now configure the component to write output embeddings and their associated metadata directly to a specified Qdrant vector database collection. This serves as an alternative destination to Keboola Storage tables. Configuration requires the Qdrant URL, API Key, and target Collection Name. Data is sent as Points containing ID, vector, and payload, conforming to Qdrant's API.
*   **Native Data Type Support:** Optional support for Keboola Native Types V2 has been added. When enabled, the component utilizes native types for reading input table definitions and defining output table manifests when writing to Keboola Storage. This can change output column definitions, potentially using native array types for vectors.
*   **Internal Vector Serialization:** Generated embedding vectors are now serialized into a JSON string format immediately after generation. While ensuring correct handling for CSV output to Keboola Storage tables, this internal format differs from the list of floats expected by the new Qdrant writer.
*   **Default Vector Column Type:** When Native Types are *not* enabled, the output manifest for Keboola Storage tables now correctly defines the `vector` column as `VARCHAR` with maximum length, preventing potential truncation of the stringified vector.
