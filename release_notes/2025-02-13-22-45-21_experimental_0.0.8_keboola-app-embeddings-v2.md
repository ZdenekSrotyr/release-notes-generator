_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.8](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.8)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Embeddings: Now with Native Data Types & Qdrant Destination
Enhance your vector workflows with native data type support for metadata and a new direct output option to Qdrant vector databases.

We've rolled out significant improvements to our embeddings component, designed to offer greater flexibility and data fidelity for your AI and vector search use cases.

Key enhancements include:

*   **Keboola Native Data Types Support:** Metadata associated with your embeddings now retains its original Keboola data types (like NUMERIC, VARCHAR, DATE) instead of being converted to strings. This ensures higher fidelity between your source data and the metadata stored alongside vectors, potentially improving downstream applications. The schema definition for Keboola Table outputs has also been refined to accurately reflect these native types.
*   **Direct Output to Qdrant:** You can now send embeddings and their metadata directly to a specified Qdrant vector database collection. This provides a streamlined alternative to the standard Keboola Table output, allowing for easier integration with vector search and retrieval pipelines.

To support these features, we've standardized the internal data structures and ensured consistent vector data type handling (as lists of floats for Qdrant, VARCHAR for Keboola Tables). Configuration options have been updated to allow specifying your Qdrant connection details. These updates make the embeddings component more powerful and versatile for building sophisticated data applications.
