_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.8](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.8)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Native Types Support & New Qdrant Writer

Components now leverage Keboola Native Types for improved data handling and introduce a direct writer for Qdrant vector databases.

We've enhanced data processing components to support Keboola Native Types. Input table data types are now preserved during processing, and output tables are created using appropriate native types instead of defaulting to strings where possible. This results in higher data fidelity and more accurate schema definitions in output table manifests.

Additionally, we've introduced a new destination writer specifically for Qdrant vector databases. Components generating embeddings can now send these vectors and associated metadata directly to a designated Qdrant collection. A new configuration parameter, `collection_name`, allows you to specify the target collection within your Qdrant instance. We've also corrected the data type definition for embedding vectors to ensure they are correctly formatted for storage and retrieval in Qdrant.

Other internal code reorganizations were performed to improve maintainability.
