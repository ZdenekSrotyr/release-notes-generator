## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock Vector Search & Native Types in Your Processing
Enhance your data processing with direct Qdrant output for vector embeddings and improved type handling using Keboola Native Types.

We've updated our data processing component (version 0.0.8) with significant enhancements to give you more power and flexibility.

Now, you can send your generated embeddings and metadata directly to a Qdrant vector database collection. This integration allows you to leverage Qdrant's efficient similarity search capabilities on your processed data, moving beyond simple CSV outputs. Configure the new `writer` parameter to `qdrant` and provide your Qdrant instance details (`qdrant_url`, `#qdrant_api_key`, `collection_name`) to get started.

Additionally, we've introduced support for Keboola Native Types. By enabling the `support_native_types` configuration flag, the component will now preserve the original Keboola data types (like Integer, Float, Decimal) when reading input tables, instead of defaulting to strings. This leads to more accurate data representation throughout your workflow and ensures correct type information in output CSV manifests. Internal improvements, including structured configuration and refined data writing logic, support these new features for a more robust experience.
