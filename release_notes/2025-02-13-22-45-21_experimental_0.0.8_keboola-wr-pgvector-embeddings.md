_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.8](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.8)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component Adds Qdrant Writer and Native Type Support
The Embeddings V2 component now supports writing directly to Qdrant vector databases and utilizes Keboola's native data types for improved data handling.

We have updated the Embeddings V2 component with significant new features and improvements.

A new writer enables sending generated embeddings and associated metadata directly to a Qdrant vector database. This integration allows specifying the target collection name within the component configuration. The vector data type used when writing to Qdrant has been corrected to ensure accurate storage.

The component now supports Keboola's native data types (`kbc_options={"native_data_types": True}`). This preserves original data types from input tables during processing and ensures output destinations use appropriate types, enhancing data accuracy. Fixes were applied to ensure correct type handling and that output table definitions in Keboola Storage accurately reflect the data schema, especially when native types are enabled.

Internal code reorganization was performed to support these updates.
