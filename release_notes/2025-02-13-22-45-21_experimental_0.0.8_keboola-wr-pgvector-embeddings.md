## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component Update: Qdrant Writer & Native CSV Data Types
Our Embeddings component now directly integrates with Qdrant vector databases and offers native data type support for CSV outputs.

We've enhanced the Embeddings component with two significant updates designed to give you more flexibility and control over your data outputs.

First, you can now write your generated embeddings and associated metadata directly to a Qdrant vector database collection. This provides a powerful alternative to CSV output, allowing you to seamlessly integrate your embeddings into vector search and similarity applications. Simply configure the connection details (URL, API key) and specify your target collection name, and the component will upsert data points containing an ID, the embedding vector, and a payload derived from your other input columns.

Second, we've introduced native data type support for CSV outputs. By enabling the new `native_data_types` flag in your configuration, the component will preserve the original data types (like integers and floats) from your input table in the output CSV file. This ensures greater data fidelity and avoids unnecessary type conversions. If the flag is not enabled, the component retains its previous behavior of converting all columns to strings.

These updates streamline the process of utilizing embeddings in specialized databases and improve the accuracy of data representation in traditional CSV files.
