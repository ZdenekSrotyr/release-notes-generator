**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Embedding Generation: Native Types & Qdrant Integration
This update introduces Keboola Native Data Type support and Qdrant as a new destination for your embedding data.

We've significantly enhanced our embedding generation component by integrating Keboola Native Data Type support. The component now reads and writes data using native types, ensuring that data types for all metadata columns are preserved from input to output. This eliminates potential type conversions (e.g., to string) and maintains data integrity throughout your workflow.

Alongside improved type handling, you can now choose to send your generated embeddings and associated metadata directly to a Qdrant vector database. This provides a powerful alternative output destination optimized for vector search applications. You can configure the target Qdrant collection name, and the component automatically sets appropriate vector parameters (size and Cosine distance) upon collection creation.

Further refinements include corrections to the output table schema when using native types with Keboola Storage output, ensuring all original metadata columns are correctly carried over. The data type for the embedding `vector` column is also now accurately set to `FLOAT`. These updates enhance data accuracy and unlock new possibilities for integrating embedding data with vector search platforms like Qdrant.
