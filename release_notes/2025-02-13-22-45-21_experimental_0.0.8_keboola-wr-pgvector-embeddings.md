#  keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings 0.0.8

_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.8](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.8)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component Adds Qdrant Destination & Type Handling

Send embeddings and typed metadata directly to Qdrant, plus improved CSV type definitions.

You can now configure the component to write generated embeddings and their associated metadata directly to a Qdrant vector database. A new Qdrant writer handles the connection, optional collection creation, and upserting of vectors and payloads based on your configuration (URL, API Key, Collection Name).

Alongside this, metadata handling has been enhanced. The component now attempts to preserve the original data types (such as integer, float, boolean, date, timestamp) of your metadata columns when writing to destinations like Qdrant, instead of converting everything to strings. This ensures better data fidelity downstream.

Additionally, for CSV outputs, the generated table manifest in Keboola Storage now includes more accurate Keboola data type definitions for columns.
