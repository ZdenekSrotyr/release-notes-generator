**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Level Up Your Vector Workflows: Native Types & Qdrant Output Now Available
Introducing native data type support for metadata and a direct writer to the Qdrant vector database in our vector processing component.

We've rolled out significant enhancements to improve flexibility and streamline your vector embedding workflows.

Previously, all metadata associated with your embeddings might have been processed as strings. Now, you can preserve the original data types (like numeric or boolean) for your metadata columns. Simply enable the new `datatype_support` parameter to maintain data fidelity when processing and storing your results. This ensures your metadata retains its intended format for downstream use, whether in CSV files or vector databases.

Furthermore, we've added a powerful new writer option: Qdrant. You can now send your embeddings and metadata directly to a specified Qdrant vector database collection. Configure the connection using the new parameters for the Qdrant URL, API key, and collection name. This integration provides a seamless way to load data structured perfectly for vector search and analysis directly into Qdrant, alongside adjustments for optimal vector storage settings within the database.
