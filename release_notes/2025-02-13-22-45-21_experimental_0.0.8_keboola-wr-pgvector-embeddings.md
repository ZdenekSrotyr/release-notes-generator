#  keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings 0.0.8

_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.8](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.8)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Component Update: Qdrant Writer & Native Data Types

Excerpt: Directly output embeddings to Qdrant and benefit from improved native data type handling during input.

Post detail:
This component update introduces significant enhancements for data handling and output destinations. A new Qdrant writer has been added, enabling you to send generated embeddings and associated metadata directly to a specified Qdrant vector database collection. Configuration requires providing Qdrant connection details (URL, API key) and using the new `collection_name` parameter to designate the target collection within your Qdrant instance.

Additionally, the component now preserves data integrity more effectively by attempting to load data from input tables using their native data types (such as numeric or boolean) rather than converting everything to strings initially. Complementing this, output data types have been refined, ensuring vector embeddings are correctly formatted (e.g., as float types) for compatibility with destinations like Qdrant and for accurate representation in output manifests.
