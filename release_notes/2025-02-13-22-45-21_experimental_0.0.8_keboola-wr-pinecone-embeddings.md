**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component Now Writes Directly to Qdrant

The Embeddings component now supports sending results directly to Qdrant vector databases and offers improved handling of native data types.

The latest update to our Embeddings component (v0.0.8) introduces a significant new capability: the ability to send your generated embeddings and associated metadata directly to a Qdrant vector database. Instead of only writing results to Keboola Storage tables, you can now configure the component to push data straight into your specified Qdrant collection. This streamlines workflows for vector search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and other AI applications by placing your embeddings exactly where you need them. Configuration is straightforward, requiring your Qdrant instance details (URL, API Key) and the target collection name within the component settings.

Alongside the Qdrant integration, this update enhances the component's handling of Keboola's native data types (like numeric, date, timestamp). When reading input tables and creating output manifests, data types are now preserved with greater fidelity, reducing potential string conversions and ensuring better data accuracy throughout your processing pipeline. These improvements make the Embeddings component more robust and versatile for preparing your data for AI-powered tasks.
