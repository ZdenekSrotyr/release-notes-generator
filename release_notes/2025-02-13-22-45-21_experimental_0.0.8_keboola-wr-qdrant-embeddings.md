#  keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings 0.0.8

_Released on 2025-02-13_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.8](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.8)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Supercharge Embeddings: Native Types & Qdrant Writer Added
Enhance your vector workflows with native data type support and direct Qdrant output in the updated Embeddings component.

The Embeddings component (v2) has been significantly updated to offer greater flexibility and data fidelity in your vector processing pipelines.

Key enhancements include:
*   **Native Data Type Support:** Say goodbye to automatic string conversion for payload columns! The component now respects Keboola's native data types (like numeric and boolean) for non-embedding columns. This means the data written to Keboola Storage or Qdrant will maintain its original type, providing richer and more accurate context alongside your embeddings.
*   **Direct Qdrant Output:** Seamlessly integrate your embeddings and associated metadata directly into your Qdrant vector database. Configure the component with your Qdrant URL, API key, and target collection name to write data points efficiently, including correctly formatted embedding vectors (as lists of floats) and typed payloads.
*   **Improved Output & Configuration:** The output CSV manifest in Keboola Storage has been refined to align better with native types. Additionally, the Qdrant writer allows specifying a target collection name directly in the configuration for easier management.

These updates streamline the process of generating and storing embeddings, ensuring better data quality and enabling direct integration with Qdrant for advanced vector search and analysis use cases.
