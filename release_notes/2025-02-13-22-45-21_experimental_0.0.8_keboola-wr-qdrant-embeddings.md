**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.8](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.8)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component: Now Supports Native Types & Qdrant

Update brings native data type input support and a new Qdrant writer to the embeddings component.

We've updated the embeddings component with significant enhancements for easier data handling and broader integration possibilities.

You can now process data directly from tables using Keboola's native data types (like Snowflake or BigQuery), eliminating the need for intermediate CSV files and streamlining your input process. Additionally, we've introduced a new Qdrant writer, allowing you to send calculated embeddings directly to your Qdrant vector database alongside the existing CSV output option. Configure the connection details and target collection easily within the component settings.

This update also includes corrections to ensure embedding vectors are stored accurately in Qdrant and that the output CSV table metadata (manifest) is correctly defined in Keboola Connection.
