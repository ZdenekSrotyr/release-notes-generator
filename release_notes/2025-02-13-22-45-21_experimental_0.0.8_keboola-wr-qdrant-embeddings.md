**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)

**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## New Feature: Write Directly to Qdrant Vector Database & Enhanced CSV Metadata

Introducing the Qdrant Writer for direct vector database integration and enhanced CSV output schema definitions.

We have added a new output option allowing you to write processed embeddings and associated metadata directly to a specified Qdrant vector database collection. When configured, this serves as an alternative destination to the default CSV file output. To use this feature, you will need to set the destination parameter to 'qdrant' and provide connection details, including the Qdrant host, API key (if applicable), and the target collection name via the new `collection_name` configuration parameter. We've also ensured vectors are stored using the appropriate data type within Qdrant for correct storage and potential search performance benefits.

Additionally, we have improved the metadata generated for standard CSV outputs. Output table manifests (`manifest.json`) now define more specific column types, such as `FLOAT` or `INTEGER`, leveraging Keboola's native data types feature. This change does not affect the data values within the CSV files but enhances the associated schema definition, allowing Keboola Storage to potentially handle the data more effectively. Refinements have also been made to how output table columns and primary keys are defined in these manifests.
