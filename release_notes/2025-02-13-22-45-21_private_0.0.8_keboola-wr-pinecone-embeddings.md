**Title**
Component Update: Qdrant Writer & Native Type Support

**Excerpt**
Send processed data to Qdrant and benefit from enhanced Keboola data type handling.

**Post detail**
This component version introduces significant improvements in data type management. It now reads column types directly from Keboola Storage input table metadata and utilizes Keboola's native data types (like `VARCHAR`, `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`) when creating output tables. This ensures greater type precision and consistency between your input and output data within Keboola.

We've added a new output destination: you can now write processed data, including embeddings and associated metadata, directly to a Qdrant vector database. Simply configure the connection details and specify your target collection name in the component parameters. This enables you to seamlessly integrate processed data into your vector search applications.

This update also includes corrections to ensure the Qdrant collection is configured with the correct vector parameters (size, distance metric) and that output tables in Keboola Storage are created with the intended primary keys. Underlying code refactoring supports these enhancements and improves maintainability.
