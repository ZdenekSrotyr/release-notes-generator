## Change log (AI generated):
## Primary Keys Prioritized in Metadata Column Order
We've updated metadata column sorting to prioritize primary keys, making them easier to identify.

We've refined the way columns are ordered within table metadata displays and storage. Previously, columns were sorted solely based on their names alphabetically.

With this update, primary key columns are now listed first, followed by the remaining columns sorted alphabetically by name. This prioritizes key structural information, making it easier and faster to identify primary keys when viewing table metadata.

This change only impacts the presentation order of columns in the metadata; your actual table data, its values, and the set of included columns remain unaffected.
