## Change log (AI generated):
## Salesforce Extractor: Correct Primary Key Order from SOQL
The Salesforce extractor now ensures the primary key column order in the output manifest strictly follows the SOQL query.

We have updated the Salesforce extractor to refine how the primary key column order is defined in the output table manifest.

Previously, the order of columns listed in the manifest's primary key (`manifest['primary_key']`) was based on their sequence in the extracted CSV file header. Now, this order will strictly follow the sequence of columns as defined in your SOQL query. The overall list of table columns (`manifest['columns']`) will continue to be based on the CSV header order.

This change ensures the primary key definition accurately reflects the intended structure from the SOQL query. It enhances the reliability of downstream processing within Keboola Connection, particularly for operations like incremental loading or data updates that depend on a precise primary key definition to identify unique rows correctly. This alignment prevents potential issues that could arise from discrepancies between the SOQL query's column order and the CSV file's header order when defining the primary key.
