## Change log (AI generated):
## Consistent CSV File Formatting Across Platforms
We've enhanced our CSV file generation to ensure correct line endings and prevent blank rows, regardless of your operating system.
We have implemented an update to improve the consistency of CSV files generated within the Keboola platform. This change addresses potential inconsistencies in line endings that could occur depending on the operating system used.

Previously, certain configurations, particularly on Windows systems, might have resulted in CSV files containing extra blank rows due to how line endings were handled. We've refined the file writing process to explicitly manage newline characters, ensuring standardized output.

This update guarantees cleaner, more consistently formatted CSV files, improving compatibility and preventing unexpected blank rows in your data exports. No action is required on your part to benefit from this enhancement.
