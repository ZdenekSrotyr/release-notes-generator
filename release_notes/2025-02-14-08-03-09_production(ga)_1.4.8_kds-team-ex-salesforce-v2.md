## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Salesforce Extractor: Enhanced Data Integrity for Column Mismatches
Excerpt: Ensures correct data placement in Salesforce Extractor, even when column mismatches occur with Native Data Types enabled.
Post detail:
We've updated the Salesforce Extractor to improve data handling in specific situations. Previously, when using the "Native Data Types" feature, if Salesforce returned fewer columns than requested for a table (often due to field-level permissions), the data in the output table could become misaligned.

To ensure data integrity, the extractor now automatically detects this column mismatch scenario when Native Data Types are enabled. For any affected table, it will log a warning and revert to the legacy data writing method specifically for that table. This utilizes the legacy writer's robust column mapping capabilities, guaranteeing that your data lands in the correct columns even when discrepancies arise between requested and returned fields. This change enhances the reliability of data extraction, particularly when dealing with complex permission setups in Salesforce.

Additionally, the internal component version has been updated.
