**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Snowflake Writer: Enhanced Numeric Type Mapping
Excerpt: The Snowflake writer now maps numeric source columns ('NT') to the NUMBER data type for improved accuracy.
Post detail:
We have updated the data type mapping within the Snowflake writer component. Previously, columns identified with the source type 'NT' (indicating numeric data) were mapped to the VARCHAR data type in Snowflake.

This mapping has been changed. Now, source columns typed as 'NT' will be correctly mapped to Snowflake's native NUMBER data type during the writing process. This ensures your numeric data retains its intended type, improving data integrity and consistency within your Snowflake tables.



## Changes:



- Fix correct NT SF type 




- PR #11 




- Update VERSION
