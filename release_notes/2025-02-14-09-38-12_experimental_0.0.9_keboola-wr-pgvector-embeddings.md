**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.9](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.9)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Snowflake to Quadrant Data Type Mapping
Enhanced data type mapping ensures Snowflake integer columns (`NUMBER(x,0)`) are correctly represented as `INT` in Quadrant collections.

We've refined how Quadrant collection schemas are defined based on Snowflake table metadata, improving the accuracy of data type mapping between the two platforms.

Specifically, Snowflake columns defined with the `NUMBER(x,0)` data type (representing integers) will now be correctly mapped to the `INT` type in Quadrant. Our system also now prioritizes the `sqlType` metadata key over the `type` key when available, enabling more precise type mapping from the source.

This enhancement ensures greater data type consistency when creating Quadrant collections from Snowflake data, leading to more reliable schema definitions.
