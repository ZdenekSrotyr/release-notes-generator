_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.9](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.9)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Updated Snowflake Data Type Mapping for FLOAT Columns
We've changed the Snowflake data type for source columns identified as FLOAT from NUMBER(38,9) to the native FLOAT type.

We have implemented an update to how Keboola components handle floating-point data types when writing to Snowflake destinations. Previously, source columns identified as `FLOAT` were mapped and created as `NUMBER(38,9)` in Snowflake.

With this change, these columns will now be mapped and created using Snowflake's native `FLOAT` data type. This adjustment aligns our data type mapping more closely with standard practices for floating-point numbers in Snowflake.

Please be aware that this change alters the schema of newly created or updated output tables in Snowflake. The switch from `NUMBER(38,9)` to `FLOAT` might affect the precision of stored values or how downstream tools and queries interpret the column type. Review your downstream processes if they rely specifically on the `NUMBER(38,9)` type for columns containing float data.
