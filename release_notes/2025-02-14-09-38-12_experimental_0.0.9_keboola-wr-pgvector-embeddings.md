## Change log (AI generated):
# Refined Snowflake Integer Data Type Mapping
Integer mapping to Snowflake is now explicitly defined as NUMBER(38, 0) for improved schema consistency.

We have updated how integer data types originating from `numpy.int_` are mapped when writing data to Snowflake. Previously, these types were implicitly mapped to Snowflake's generic `NUMBER` data type.

This mapping is now explicitly defined as `NUMBER(38, 0)`. This change enhances the predictability and consistency of target table schema definitions in Snowflake, ensuring integer columns derived from `numpy.int_` are always created with a specific precision and zero scale. This update primarily affects schema definitions and is unlikely to alter stored data values.
