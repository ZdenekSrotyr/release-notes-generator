#  keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings 0.0.9

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.9](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.9)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Snowflake Compatibility for Embedding Columns
We've refined the output table schema definition for embedding columns in Snowflake to ensure seamless data handling.

We have updated the way output table manifests are created when using the Snowflake backend. Specifically, the metadata for the `_embedding` column now explicitly defines its base data type (`KBC.datatype.basetype`) as `NUMERIC`.

This adjustment improves compatibility with Snowflake's data handling mechanisms, particularly relevant as native vector type support evolves. By defining the column as `NUMERIC` in the manifest, we ensure reliable data writing via Snowflake's Storage API.

It's important to note that the actual embedding values stored in your tables remain exactly the same. This change only affects the column's type definition within the table manifest (metadata), ensuring a more robust integration with Snowflake. No action is required on your part.
