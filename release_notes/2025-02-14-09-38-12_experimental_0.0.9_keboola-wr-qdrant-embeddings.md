**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Refined Snowflake Data Type for Floating-Point Numbers
We've updated how 32-bit floating-point numbers (`numpy.float32`) are stored in Snowflake output tables for enhanced precision.

We have implemented a change in how our Python components handle certain floating-point data types when creating tables in Snowflake. Specifically, values originating as `numpy.float32` will now be mapped to the `NUMBER(38, 9)` data type in Snowflake, replacing the previous `FLOAT` type.

This update ensures a more precise, fixed-point representation for 32-bit floating-point numbers. This is particularly beneficial for use cases involving data like vector embeddings, where maintaining consistent precision is crucial. Using `NUMBER(38, 9)` avoids potential representation variations sometimes associated with the standard `FLOAT` type, leading to more predictable storage and potentially improved query performance for these specific numeric values within Snowflake. This change affects newly created or fully rebuilt Snowflake tables generated by relevant Python components.
