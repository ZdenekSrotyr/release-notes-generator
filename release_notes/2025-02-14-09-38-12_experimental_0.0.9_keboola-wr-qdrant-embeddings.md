**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.9](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.9)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Code Maintenance Update
We've performed routine code maintenance, renaming an imported task class within a component's code structure.

This update involves an internal code refinement within the `component.py` file. Specifically, the imported task class `DownloadTable` has been renamed to `DownloadTableTask`, and its usage updated accordingly throughout the file.

This is a structural code change aimed at improving maintainability and clarity. It does not modify the sequence or internal logic of the data processing steps executed by the component's main Python code. The component's behavior related to this task remains dependent on the implementation of the `DownloadTableTask` class within the external `kbc_embeddings` library.
