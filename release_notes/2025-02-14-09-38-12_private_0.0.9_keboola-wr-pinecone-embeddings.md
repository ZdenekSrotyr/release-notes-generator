#  keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings 0.0.9

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.9](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.9)  
**Stage:** PRIVATE


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Vector Output Data Type Corrected to REAL

**Excerpt:** Output manifest generation now correctly declares the `_vector` column data type as REAL.

**Post detail:**
The data type declared for the `_vector` column within output table manifests has been corrected. Previously, it was declared as `INT`.

This declaration has now been updated to `REAL`, accurately reflecting the floating-point nature of vector embedding values. This ensures the output table schema definition is precise, improving data interpretation and compatibility with destination systems, such as Snowflake Native Tables, that rely on the manifest for table creation.



## Changes:



- Fix correct NT SF type 




- PR #11 




- Update VERSION
