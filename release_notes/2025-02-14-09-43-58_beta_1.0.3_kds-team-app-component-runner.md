**Stage:** BETA


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Component Awareness for GCP Environments
Components now automatically detect if they are running within a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) stack, improving operational consistency.

As Keboola continues to expand its multi-cloud capabilities, we've updated how our components identify their operating environment.

The component runner logic has been enhanced to correctly determine the Keboola stack ID based on the `KBC_URL` environment variable, now including support for GCP stacks alongside existing AWS stacks.

This update ensures components are fully aware of their context when running in a GCP environment. This is an internal improvement focused on operational consistency and does not affect your data processing logic, transformations, or how input/output data is handled.



## Changes:



- GCP stacks allowed & available for selection in the UI 




- Merged in SUPPORT-10780-component-runner-in-gcp (pull request #3)
