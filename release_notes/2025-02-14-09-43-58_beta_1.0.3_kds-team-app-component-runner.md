## Change log (AI generated):
## Runner Update: Choose Your Execution Backend

Gain control over your component's execution environment by selecting the desired backend stack directly in the configuration.

We have enhanced the component runner's capabilities. The runner now selects the specific execution backend, such as 'docker' or 'kubernetes', based on the 'stack' defined in the component's configuration. Previously, the backend selection was less explicit.

This change gives you direct control over the underlying infrastructure where your component task executes, potentially impacting performance or resource availability depending on the chosen stack (e.g., AWS vs. GCP). Note that this modification affects the execution environment only and does not alter the data transformation logic within the component itself.

Supporting this new functionality, configuration management has been updated to recognize and handle different 'stacks'. Additionally, the component configuration interface now dynamically generates a dropdown menu, allowing you to select from the available execution stacks defined for your environment.



## Changes:



- GCP stacks allowed & available for selection in the UI 




- Merged in SUPPORT-10780-component-runner-in-gcp (pull request #3)
