**Component:** [kds-team.app-component-runner](https://github.com/keboola/component-component-runner)  
**Tag:** [1.0.3](https://github.com/keboola/component-component-runner/releases/tag/1.0.3)  
**Stage:** BETA


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: New Backend Stack: Google Cloud Platform
Excerpt: Added support for the 'google' backend stack, enabling components to recognize GCP environments.
Post detail:
We have updated component runners to include 'google' as a supported backend stack. This change was implemented in the `src/component.py` file.

This enhancement allows components to identify when they are operating within a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment by checking the `KBC_PROJECT_STACK` environment variable. It primarily impacts configuration validation and environment setup specific to GCP deployments.

This update does not alter core data processing logic, the handling of input/output data, or the execution of user component code.



## Changes:



- GCP stacks allowed & available for selection in the UI 




- Merged in SUPPORT-10780-component-runner-in-gcp (pull request #3)
