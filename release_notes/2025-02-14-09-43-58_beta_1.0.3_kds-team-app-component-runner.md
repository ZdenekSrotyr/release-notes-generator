## Change log (AI generated):
## Components Now Aware of Their Cloud Environment
Components now receive a `stack_type` environment variable indicating whether they are running on AWS, Azure, or GCP.

We've enhanced the component execution environment by adding awareness of the underlying Keboola cloud stack. Components will now automatically receive a new environment variable, `stack_type`, indicating whether they are operating on AWS, Azure, or GCP. This information is derived from the project's `KBC_URL`.

This `stack_type` variable allows component developers to implement stack-specific logic or configurations if needed. Additionally, the component runner can now leverage this stack information to enable specific features or optimizations tailored to the cloud environment, such as the `container-root-user-mapping` feature currently available for AWS stacks.

This update provides greater context to components and allows for more flexible and potentially optimized execution depending on the specific Keboola stack being used, without altering the core data processing logic of the runner itself.



## Changes:



- GCP stacks allowed & available for selection in the UI 




- Merged in SUPPORT-10780-component-runner-in-gcp (pull request #3)
