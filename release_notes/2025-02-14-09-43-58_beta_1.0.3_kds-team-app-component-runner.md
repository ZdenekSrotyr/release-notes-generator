**Component:** [kds-team.app-component-runner](https://github.com/keboola/component-component-runner)

**Stage:** BETA


## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Compatibility Extended to GCP Stacks
Components can now be configured for Keboola Connection projects running on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) backend stack.

Component runner configuration has been updated to include 'gcp' as a supported Keboola Connection backend stack.
This enhancement allows components to be correctly configured and initialize within Keboola projects operating on Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. The primary impact relates to environment setup, potentially influencing details like Storage API endpoint resolution, but does not change the component's core data processing functionality.
Validation logic has also been added to specifically recognize the 'gcp' stack during component initialization and provide a clear error message if an unknown stack is encountered, ensuring robust configuration handling across different backend environments.



## Changes:



- GCP stacks allowed & available for selection in the UI 




- Merged in SUPPORT-10780-component-runner-in-gcp (pull request #3)
