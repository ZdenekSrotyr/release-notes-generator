**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Reliability and Error Handling for Embeddings Component
Embeddings generation is now more robust with proactive input validation and clearer error reporting for external API issues.

We've updated our embeddings component to enhance its reliability and provide a smoother user experience, especially when issues arise. While the core embedding generation logic remains unchanged for successful runs, this update introduces significant improvements in how the component handles errors.

Key enhancements include:
*   **Improved External API Error Handling:** The component now specifically catches connection or API errors when communicating with services like OpenAI or Azure. Instead of generic failures, it raises clearer, more informative errors pinpointing the external service issue.
*   **Proactive Input Validation:** We've added checks to verify that your input data contains the necessary columns (`texts_key`, `primary_key`) before processing begins. This prevents runs from failing midway due to incorrect data structure, saving time and resources.
*   **Standardized Platform Errors:** All component-specific errors, including the new API and validation issues, are now translated into user-friendly `UserException` messages within the Keboola platform, making it easier to diagnose and resolve problems.

These changes ensure that you receive more precise feedback when configurations are incorrect or external services are unavailable, leading to faster troubleshooting and more resilient data pipelines.
