## Change log (AI generated):
## Clearer Error Messages for Component Runs
Components now provide more specific error messages, making troubleshooting easier.

We've rolled out an update focused on improving the stability and maintainability of our components by enhancing how errors are handled. While the core data processing logic remains unchanged for successful operations, this update significantly refines how failures are reported.

Specifically, we've replaced generic error messages with more specific, custom exceptions (`ApplicationException` and `UserException`). This means if something goes wrong during component initialization or processing (like using an invalid model name or encountering issues during embedding generation), you'll now receive clearer, more actionable error messages.

This change, supported by an update to our internal libraries, helps you and our support team diagnose and resolve issues more quickly, leading to a smoother experience when troubleshooting.
