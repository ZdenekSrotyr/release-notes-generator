## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Handling in OpenAI Component
Error reporting in the OpenAI component is now more specific, helping you diagnose issues faster.

We've refined the error handling within the OpenAI component. It now specifically identifies and catches common OpenAI API issues, including rate limits (`RateLimitError`), connection problems (`APIConnectionError`), timeouts (`Timeout`), and other API errors (`APIError`), along with generic exceptions.

These caught errors are re-raised as `UserException`, providing you with more precise information about the cause of a failure. This improvement leads to clearer error messages for faster troubleshooting, while the core functionality and output for successful runs remain unchanged.



## Changes:



- Add improved error handling
