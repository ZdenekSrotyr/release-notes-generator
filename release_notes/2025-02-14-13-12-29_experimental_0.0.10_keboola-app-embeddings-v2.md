## Change log (AI generated):
## Clearer Error Messages for OpenAI Interactions
Troubleshoot faster with enhanced error reporting for components interacting with the OpenAI API.

We've improved how our components handle errors when communicating with the OpenAI API. While the core data processing logic remains unchanged for successful runs, we've introduced more specific exception handling for issues encountered during these interactions.

Previously, certain API errors might have resulted in less specific messages. Now, common issues like API availability problems, rate limits (`RateLimitError`), authentication failures (`AuthenticationError`), or invalid requests (`BadRequestError`) are explicitly caught and reported back to you as clear, understandable `UserException` errors. This enhancement ensures you receive more informative feedback when something goes wrong, simplifying debugging and improving the overall robustness of your workflows using OpenAI services.
