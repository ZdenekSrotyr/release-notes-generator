**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.10](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.10)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Clearer Error Messages for Embedding Component
The embedding component now provides more specific error messages when issues occur during API communication.

We have enhanced the error handling within the embedding component during interactions with the embedding API.
The component now explicitly catches specific issues such as API errors (`requests.HTTPError`) and timeouts (`requests.Timeout`), as well as general exceptions that might occur when retrieving the API URL or the embeddings themselves.
Instead of potentially generic failures, these caught exceptions are now re-raised using a new custom `UserException`. This results in more specific and informative error messages being presented to the user, making it easier to diagnose the root cause of failures related to API communication.
This update focuses solely on improving error reporting and diagnostics; it does not alter the component's data processing logic or the output generated during successful executions.
