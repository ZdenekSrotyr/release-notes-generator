_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.10](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.10)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Clearer OpenAI API Error Reporting

Excerpt: The component interacting with OpenAI now provides more specific error messages for easier troubleshooting.

Post detail:
We've enhanced the error handling for components that call the OpenAI API, specifically around embedding creation. Previously, some API or network issues might have resulted in a generic error.

Now, the component specifically identifies and reports common problems like OpenAI rate limits (`RateLimitError`), general API issues (`APIError`), network timeouts (`Timeout`), HTTP errors (`HTTPError`), and connection problems (`ConnectionError`). When these specific issues occur, you will receive a `UserException` with a clearer message pinpointing the cause, simplifying debugging and resolution. This change focuses solely on improving error reporting; the core logic for successful embedding generation remains unaffected.
