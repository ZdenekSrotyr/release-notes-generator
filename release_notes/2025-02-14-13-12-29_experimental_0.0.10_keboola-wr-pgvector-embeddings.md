## Change log (AI generated):
## Embedding Component: Enhanced Validation and Error Handling
The embedding component now features improved input data validation and more specific error handling for increased reliability during configuration and execution.

This update introduces enhanced validation checks and more robust error handling mechanisms within the embedding component.

Key changes include input data validation, which now verifies that the list of texts provided for embedding is not empty and contains only string values before processing begins. This prevents attempts to process invalid data structures, ensuring the component fails early with an `InputDataError` if the input is unsuitable. Additionally, model configuration validation ensures that a `model_name` is provided before attempting to load the model, preventing runs from starting without this essential parameter via a `ConfigurationError`.

To support clearer error identification, new custom exception classes have been introduced. Structured error handling has been implemented throughout the component, utilizing these custom exceptions (`ModelError`, `ConfigurationError`, `InputDataError`) to catch potential issues during model loading, embedding calculation, and general execution. These specific errors are typically translated into `UserException` messages surfaced in the Keboola platform, improving the clarity and robustness of error reporting when failures occur.
