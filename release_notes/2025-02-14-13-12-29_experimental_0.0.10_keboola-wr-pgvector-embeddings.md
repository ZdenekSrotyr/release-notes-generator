**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.10](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.10)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Enhanced Error Diagnostics for Components

**Excerpt:** Components now provide more specific and helpful error messages during failures.

**Post Detail:**
We've refined error handling within components to offer better diagnostics when things go wrong. This involves the introduction of specific custom exception classes, namely `UserException` and `ApplicationException`.

Standard errors encountered during processing, like API communication problems or configuration validation issues, are now captured and reported using these more specific exception types. This leads to clearer, more informative error messages in your job logs when a failure occurs, helping you pinpoint the cause more quickly.

This change does not affect the logic or output data for successful job runs. However, due to the improved classification of errors, you might observe different error messages or exit codes for failed runs compared to previous behavior.
