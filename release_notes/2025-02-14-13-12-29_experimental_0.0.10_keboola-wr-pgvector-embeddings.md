**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Component Stability: Clearer Error Reporting

Data processing components now provide more specific and informative error messages when issues occur.

We have refined the error handling mechanisms within our data processing components. Changes were implemented in the core Python code responsible for managing operations like external API interactions.

The updated components are now better equipped to catch specific exceptions that might arise during execution, such as network timeouts or API-related issues. Instead of relying on potentially generic messages, these components will raise custom, more descriptive application errors. This improvement provides clearer feedback when a process fails, making it easier to diagnose and resolve the underlying problem. This change affects only how errors are reported; the core data processing logic for successful operations remains unaffected.
