## Change log (AI generated):
## Clearer Errors for Text Embedding Component
Updates to the text embedding component provide more specific and user-friendly error messages for easier troubleshooting.

We've enhanced the error handling capabilities of our text embedding component to improve robustness and make troubleshooting easier.

While the core functionality of generating text embeddings remains unchanged for successful runs, this update focuses on how the component reports issues. We have replaced generic error messages with more specific, custom exceptions.

Now, if an error occurs during processes like configuration loading, model loading, or embedding generation, the component will raise a clearer, more informative error message. This means you'll get better feedback pinpointing the source of the problem, helping you resolve issues faster without sifting through less specific tracebacks. This change improves the overall reliability and usability of the component.
