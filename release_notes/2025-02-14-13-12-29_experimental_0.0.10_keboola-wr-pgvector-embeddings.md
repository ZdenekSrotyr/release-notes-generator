## Change log (AI generated):
## Refined Error Reporting for Easier Debugging
Introduced enhanced error reporting to help you identify and fix issues faster.

We've updated the error handling mechanism within one of our components to provide clearer and more actionable feedback when things don't go as planned. This change involves introducing custom `UserException` types and wrapping key operations—like configuration validation, data loading, and API calls—in more robust error-catching blocks.

Previously, certain configuration mistakes, data issues, or API problems might have resulted in generic error messages. Now, standard errors encountered during these steps are caught and re-classified as `UserException`. This categorization helps distinguish issues that you can likely resolve yourself (like correcting a configuration setting) from deeper system problems.

This improvement doesn't change how the component processes data when everything is configured correctly. Its main goal is to streamline the debugging process by making error messages more informative and pointing you towards user-correctable issues more directly.
