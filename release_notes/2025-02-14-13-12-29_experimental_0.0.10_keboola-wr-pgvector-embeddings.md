**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Component Stability and Error Reporting
This update introduces enhanced error handling mechanisms for increased component robustness and improved diagnostics.

This component update focuses on enhancing stability and improving the user experience when errors occur.

We've implemented more robust error handling, including better exception catching and more informative error messages.

These changes mean the component is more resilient to issues like API problems or configuration errors, providing clearer feedback to help you diagnose and resolve problems faster.

Importantly, these improvements do not affect the component's core data processing logic or output data during successful runs. Your successful pipelines will continue to operate exactly as before, but with added resilience against potential failures.



## Changes:



- Add improved error handling 






- PR #12
