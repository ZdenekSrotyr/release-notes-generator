**Component:** [keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.10](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.10)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Update: Enhanced Error Handling & Reliability
We've updated component error handling mechanisms to make runs more reliable and troubleshooting easier.

This update introduces enhanced error handling within components, improving their overall robustness and the clarity of error reporting. While the core data processing logic for successful executions remains unchanged, we've implemented more specific exception handling.

These improvements mean that components are better equipped to catch, classify, and report issues encountered during runtime, such as API call failures or data processing problems. Although successful runs behave exactly as before, you might notice different error messages or statuses for failed runs, ultimately leading to faster identification and resolution of problems.
