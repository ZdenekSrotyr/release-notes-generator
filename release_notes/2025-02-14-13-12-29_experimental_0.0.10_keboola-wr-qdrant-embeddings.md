**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Reporting for Embeddings
Receive more specific and informative error messages during embedding generation, especially for API-related issues.

We have improved the error handling mechanisms within our embedding components.

This update introduces more specific error classifications, particularly for issues originating from external APIs such as OpenAI. If an error occurs during embedding generation (for example, due to an invalid API key or exceeding usage quotas), the system will now catch this more precisely.

As a result, you will receive clearer and more contextual error messages surfaced directly within the Keboola platform. This enhancement aids in faster troubleshooting of configuration or API-related problems. The core data processing logic for successful embedding generation remains unchanged.
