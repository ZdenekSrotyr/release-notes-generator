**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Handling and Stability
Introduced refined error handling for increased stability and clearer troubleshooting.

We've rolled out an update focused on enhancing the stability and error reporting of our components. These changes improve how errors are handled and reported, making troubleshooting easier for you. Importantly, the core data processing logic remains unchanged during successful executions.

This update introduces more specific error categories to clearly distinguish between user configuration issues (like invalid input) and unexpected application or external API problems. We've refined the component's internal logic to use these new categories during configuration validation and execution. Additionally, handling for external API errors (such as connection issues or rate limits) has been made more robust.

As a result, you'll receive clearer, more specific feedback when configuration errors occur, helping you resolve them faster. The component is also more resilient to temporary issues with external services. Overall, this leads to a smoother experience and more predictable behavior, especially when encountering problems.
