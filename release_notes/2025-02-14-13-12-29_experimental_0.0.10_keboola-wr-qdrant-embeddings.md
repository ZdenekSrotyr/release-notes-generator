## Change log (AI generated):
## Clearer Error Messages for OpenAI API
Updates provide more specific and user-friendly error messages when OpenAI/Azure API calls fail.

We've introduced improved error handling for components interacting with the OpenAI and Azure OpenAI APIs.

Previously, generic errors could sometimes mask the underlying issue when API calls failed during operations like model initialization or embedding generation. Now, specific errors originating from the OpenAI API (`OpenAIError`) are caught and presented as clear, user-focused exceptions.

This enhancement makes troubleshooting issues related to API keys, permissions, quotas, or OpenAI service disruptions much easier, providing more direct feedback on the cause of the failure. Your data processing logic remains unaffected when API interactions are successful.
