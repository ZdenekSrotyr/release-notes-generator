**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Get Clearer Error Feedback During Processing

Excerpt: Component processing failures now result in more specific and user-friendly error messages.

Post detail:
We've enhanced the error handling within the component. When issues occur during data processing, such as problems with external API calls, the component now catches these specific errors more effectively.

Instead of potentially cryptic messages from underlying libraries, it now raises structured, informative errors designed for clarity. This improvement helps you diagnose and resolve processing issues more quickly by providing better context about what went wrong. The core logic for successful data processing remains unchanged.
