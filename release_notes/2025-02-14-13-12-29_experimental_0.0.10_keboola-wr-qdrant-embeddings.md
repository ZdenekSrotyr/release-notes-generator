**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Reporting for Embedding Generation
Updates provide more specific error messages when generating embeddings, simplifying troubleshooting.

We have implemented improvements to error handling within the embedding generation process. Previously, issues like missing columns in the input data or failures during the model encoding step could lead to less specific errors or component crashes.

Now, the component specifically catches errors related to missing required columns and model encoding failures. Instead of a generic failure, it raises a more informative error message, clearly indicating problems originating from the input data or embedding model configuration. This enhancement does not affect how embeddings are calculated for valid data but significantly improves the clarity of error reporting when data issues occur.

Additionally, we have introduced custom exception classes and refined the top-level error catching mechanism. Errors encountered during the embedding process that are likely due to configuration or input data issues are now surfaced more clearly as user-fixable problems within the Keboola platform, making it easier to diagnose and resolve them.
