**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved Error Handling for AI Model Components
We've improved error handling for AI components, ensuring clearer messages and smoother operation when model loading or API issues arise.

We have implemented several enhancements to improve the robustness and error reporting capabilities of components that utilize external AI models, such as those loading Sentence Transformers or calling the OpenAI API for embeddings.

Specifically, we've added more precise error detection within the model loading process. If a component fails to download or access a Sentence Transformer model due to an invalid model ID or network connectivity problems, it will now provide a more specific error message. Similarly, errors returned directly from the OpenAI API during embedding generation are now caught and reported more clearly.

Furthermore, we've standardized how these underlying errors are surfaced within the Keboola platform. Technical exceptions related to model access or API failures are now converted into UserExceptions, making it easier for you to understand and troubleshoot issues like incorrect configurations or temporary network disruptions. These changes do not affect the core data processing logic during successful runs but significantly improve the diagnostic information provided when failures occur.
