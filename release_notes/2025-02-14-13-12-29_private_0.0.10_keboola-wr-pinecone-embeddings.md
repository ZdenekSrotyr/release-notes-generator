## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Embeddings V2: More Robust Error Reporting

Excerpt: Enhanced error management improves the stability and failure reporting of the Embeddings V2 component.

Post detail:
We've implemented enhanced error handling within the Embeddings V2 component. This update introduces more specific custom exception classes, particularly around model interactions and data handling steps.

This change improves the component's robustness when encountering issues during processing. You will now benefit from clearer and more specific error messages if problems occur, aiding in faster identification and troubleshooting. This enhancement focuses solely on failure management and does not alter the core embedding generation logic for successful operations.
