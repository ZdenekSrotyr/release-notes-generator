## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Component Stability: Clearer Initialization Error Handling
Components now provide clearer error messages if initialization fails, preventing unexpected issues.

We've rolled out an update to enhance the stability and reliability of component initialization. Previously, issues during the setup of certain internal clients could sometimes lead to unclear errors, potential crashes later in the process, or even silent failures.

To improve this experience, we've implemented specific error handling during the initialization phase. Now, if a component encounters problems setting up necessary clients (like the vector client), it will immediately raise a clear `UserException`. This provides direct feedback about the issue, making it easier to diagnose and resolve problems without disrupting your workflow unexpectedly.

This change focuses purely on improving error reporting during startup and does not alter the core data processing logic of components when initialization is successful.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
