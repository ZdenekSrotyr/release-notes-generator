**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.11](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.11)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Vector Client Initialization Error Handling
Updates to vector client initialization provide clearer feedback on configuration or connection issues.

We have improved the error handling for components that use vector clients, such as OpenAI or Cohere, during their initialization process.

Previously, if a vector client failed to initialize due to issues like invalid credentials or connection problems, the component might fail later with a less specific error. With this update, the component will now raise a `UserException` immediately if the client initialization fails. This change ensures users receive clearer and earlier feedback about configuration or connectivity issues, enhancing the robustness of the component startup phase. The core functionality related to how embeddings are calculated remains unchanged if the client initializes successfully.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
