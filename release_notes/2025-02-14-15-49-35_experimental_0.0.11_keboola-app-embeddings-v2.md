## Change log (AI generated):
## Vector Components: Improved Connection Error Handling
We've added better error handling to vector components, making initialization failures clearer and stopping execution earlier.

We have enhanced the stability of components interacting with vector databases by improving how they handle initialization errors. Previously, issues like incorrect credentials or connection problems during the setup of the vector database client could lead to less specific errors later in the process.

Now, components will immediately check if the connection and authentication to your vector database are successful during initialization. If the client fails to initialize, the component run will stop early and raise a specific `UserException`, clearly indicating the cause of the failure (e.g., invalid credentials, unreachable host).

This change ensures you get faster, more direct feedback on configuration issues, preventing subsequent processing steps from running with an invalid client and making troubleshooting easier. The core logic for processing and handling your data remains unchanged if the initial connection is successful.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
