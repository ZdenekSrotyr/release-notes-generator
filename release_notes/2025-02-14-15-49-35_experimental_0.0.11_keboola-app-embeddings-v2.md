**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.11](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.11)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Robustness for Vector Client Initialization
Improved error handling during vector client initialization enhances component stability and provides clearer feedback on connection issues.

We have implemented enhanced error handling specifically for the initialization phase of the vector client within components. If the client fails to initialize due to issues such as incorrect credentials or network problems, a clear `UserException` is now raised, replacing potentially unhandled exceptions.

This improvement increases component robustness by ensuring an early failure with a specific error message when connection to the vector database cannot be established. It prevents subsequent processing steps from attempting to run with an invalid client, making troubleshooting easier. This change does not affect data processing logic during successful component runs.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
