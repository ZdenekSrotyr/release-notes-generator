## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Vector Client Stability: Improved Error Handling
Vector client initialization now provides specific error messages upon connection failure, preventing unexpected crashes.

We've improved the robustness of our vector client components during the initial setup phase. Previously, connection failures when initializing the connection to the vector database could sometimes lead to less informative errors later in the process.

Now, if the platform encounters issues connecting to your vector database during initialization, a specific `UserException` will be raised immediately. This provides a clear message indicating the connection problem, allowing for faster troubleshooting and preventing unexpected component failures down the line.

This enhancement ensures a smoother setup experience and clearer feedback when connection issues arise, without altering data transformation or embedding processes for successful connections.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
