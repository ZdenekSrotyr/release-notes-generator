**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.11](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.11)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Embeddings Component: Better Startup Diagnostics

**Excerpt:** The Embeddings component now offers clearer error messages during startup if vector client initialization fails.

**Post Detail:**
We've enhanced the error handling in the Embeddings component (version 0.0.11). Previously, certain failures during the initial setup of vector clients (like OpenAI or Cohere) could lead to less specific errors.

Now, if the component encounters issues connecting to or initializing the vector service – for example, due to invalid API keys or network problems – it will raise a clear `UserException`. This makes it easier to diagnose and resolve configuration problems during component startup. This update focuses solely on improving startup error reporting and does not change the core embedding generation process or the resulting data for successful runs.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
