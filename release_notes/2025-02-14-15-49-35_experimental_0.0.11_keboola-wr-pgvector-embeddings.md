**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Handling for Vector Client Initialization
Vector client setup now fails faster with specific error messages, improving component reliability and troubleshooting.

We've improved the initialization process for components utilizing a vector client connection. This update introduces more robust error handling right at the start of the component run.

Previously, issues during the vector client setup, such as incorrect credentials or connection problems, might have resulted in less specific errors occurring later in the data processing steps. Now, the component performs an upfront check. If the vector client fails to initialize successfully, a specific `UserException` is immediately raised, clearly indicating the problem and preventing the component from proceeding.

This enhancement ensures that configuration or connection issues are surfaced early, making troubleshooting faster and preventing potential downstream complications or silent failures. The core data processing logic remains unaffected when the client initializes correctly.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
