**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Fail Faster: Better Vector Client Errors

Excerpt: Get specific feedback faster when vector client setup fails.

Post detail:
We've improved the way vector components handle initialization errors. Previously, issues like incorrect credentials or invalid endpoints during the setup of the vector client could lead to less specific error messages.

Now, if the `VectorClient` fails to initialize for any reason, the component will immediately raise a `UserException`. This exception includes a specific message detailing the cause of the failure, allowing for quicker identification and correction of configuration problems.

This enhancement ensures a more robust setup experience. By failing early with clear information, it helps you troubleshoot connection or credential issues more effectively before any data processing attempts occur.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
