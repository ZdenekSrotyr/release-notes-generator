## Change log (AI generated):
## Clearer Error Messages for Vector Component Setup
Vector components now provide more user-friendly error messages during initialization.

We've improved how errors are handled when initializing connections for components using vector services (like OpenAI or Vector Databases).

Previously, issues such as invalid credentials or connection problems during setup could sometimes lead to complex or unclear error messages. With this update, if a vector client fails to initialize, a specific `UserException` is now triggered.

This change provides you with a more direct and understandable error message, making it significantly easier to identify and resolve configuration problems. This enhancement streamlines the setup process for relevant components without affecting any core data processing logic once initialization is successful.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
