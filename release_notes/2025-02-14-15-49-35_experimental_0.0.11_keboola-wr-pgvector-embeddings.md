#  keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings 0.0.11

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.11](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.11)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Clearer Errors for Vector Client Initialization
Vector components now provide clearer, user-friendly errors if client initialization fails.

We have improved error handling during the initialization phase of components utilizing vector clients, such as `QdrantClient` or `OpenAIClient`.
Previously, errors during client setup like invalid credentials or network issues might not have been clearly reported until later. Now, the component explicitly checks for successful client initialization at startup.
If the connection to the required vector service fails, the component will stop execution immediately and raise a specific `UserException`. This provides clear feedback on configuration or connection problems and prevents the component from attempting data processing with an invalid setup. Core data processing logic remains unchanged when the client initializes successfully.

## Improved Runtime Error Reporting in Components
Components now feature improved handling and reporting of unexpected runtime errors.

We have implemented more robust error handling for the main execution phase of components.
A general exception handler has been added around the core `run()` method. This ensures that any unexpected errors encountered during the component's runtime, which were not previously caught by specific error handlers, are now captured.
These caught exceptions will be reported as `UserException`s, providing clearer, more user-friendly error messages instead of raw system tracebacks. This change improves the overall stability and diagnostic clarity of component execution without altering the data processing steps themselves.
