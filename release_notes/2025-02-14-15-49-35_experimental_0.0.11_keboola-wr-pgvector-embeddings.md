## Fail Fast: Enhanced Validation for Vector Components

Improved configuration validation for vector components prevents execution with invalid settings and provides clearer error messages upfront.

We've enhanced our vector components to provide better feedback during setup. Now, when initializing the connection to your chosen vector provider (like Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.), the component performs stricter validation checks on your configuration settings.

Previously, some configuration errors might only have surfaced later during data processing. With this update, specific configuration validation errors are caught immediately upon initialization. This means if your settings are invalid (e.g., incorrect API keys, malformed endpoints), the component will fail fast with a clear error message, preventing the execution from starting with faulty parameters. This saves you time and compute credits by highlighting setup issues sooner.

This change focuses purely on improving the initialization and validation process. The core logic for generating embeddings and handling your data remains unaffected if your vector client configuration is valid. Additionally, we've refined internal logging during the client setup phase, which may help our support team diagnose potential initialization issues more effectively.
