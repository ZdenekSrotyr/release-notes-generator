**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.11](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.11)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Robust Vector DB Client Initialization
Enhanced robustness during vector database client initialization prevents proceeding with faulty connections.

We have improved the initialization process for vector database clients, such as Qdrant and Chroma.

If a client fails to initialize due to issues like invalid credentials or network problems, a `UserException` is now raised immediately. This provides clearer feedback on the cause of the failure and halts execution, preventing components from proceeding with a potentially faulty connection.

This change enhances component robustness by catching connection problems early. Core data processing logic remains unaffected when client initialization is successful.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
