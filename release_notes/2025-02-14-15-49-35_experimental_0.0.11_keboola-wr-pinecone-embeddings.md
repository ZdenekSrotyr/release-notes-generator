**Component:** [keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.11](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.11)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Reporting for Vector Client Initialization
Troubleshoot vector client setup faster with more specific error messages for initialization failures.

We've improved the error handling during the initialization phase of vector clients within components.

Previously, initialization failures could result in less specific errors. Now, if a vector client fails to initialize due to issues like incorrect credentials or connection problems, a dedicated `UserException` is raised. This provides a much clearer error message, helping you identify and resolve setup problems more quickly.

This enhancement improves the robustness and user-friendliness of components using vector clients during setup. Note that this change does not affect how embeddings are calculated or how data is processed once the client is successfully initialized.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
