## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved Error Handling for Vector Components
Vector components now provide clearer error messages and fail gracefully if connection issues occur during startup.

We have enhanced the error handling for vector components during their initialization phase. Previously, a failure to connect to the external vector service upon startup could lead to an unhandled exception and a component crash. Now, if the `VectorClient` fails to initialize, a specific `UserException` is raised. This provides a clear error message directly to you, explaining the connection issue, ensuring a more controlled failure rather than an abrupt crash. This change improves the component's robustness during startup but does not alter how your data is processed once the connection is successfully established.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
