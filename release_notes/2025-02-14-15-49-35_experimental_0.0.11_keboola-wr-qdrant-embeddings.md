## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Vector Component Error Reporting for Connection Issues
Receive clearer, more specific error messages if vector database connections fail during initialization.

We've improved the error handling within our vector components during the initial connection setup phase.

Previously, if a vector component couldn't connect to the specified vector database API during startup, the error message might have been less specific. With this update, we've added more targeted checks for connection issues. Now, if the component fails to reach the vector database API upon initialization, it will provide a clearer error message indicating a connection failure and prevent the component run from proceeding.

This enhancement ensures you get better feedback right away if there's a problem connecting to your vector database, making troubleshooting easier. Importantly, this change only affects the initialization phase and error reporting; it does not alter the core logic of how data is processed or embeddings are handled once a connection is successfully established.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
