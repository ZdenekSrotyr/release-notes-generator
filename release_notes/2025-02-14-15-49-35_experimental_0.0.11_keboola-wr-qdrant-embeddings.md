_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.11](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.11)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Vector Client Initialization Now More Robust

**Excerpt:** Initialization errors for vector clients are now handled gracefully, preventing unexpected component failures.

**Post detail:**
We've enhanced the stability of components that connect to vector databases.

Previously, issues encountered during the initial setup of the vector client connection, such as configuration mistakes or network problems, could sometimes lead to unclear component states.

Now, the component explicitly checks for errors during vector client initialization. If an issue is detected at this stage, the component will immediately stop and fail gracefully, raising a specific `KeboolaComponentError`. This change ensures that the component run provides clear feedback about initialization problems and avoids attempting data processing with an invalid setup, leading to more predictable and reliable behaviour. The core data processing logic remains unaffected if the client initialization is successful.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
