**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.11](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.11)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Vector Client: Enhanced Initialization Error Handling
Vector client components now provide more specific error messages during initialization if configuration issues occur.

We have improved the error handling for vector client initialization within relevant components. A specific check has been added around the `VectorClient` instantiation within the component's execution logic (`component.py`).

If the client fails to initialize, for instance, due to an invalid API key or an unsupported model configuration, the component will now stop execution immediately and raise a user-friendly exception. This provides a clearer, more specific error message pinpointing the configuration problem, preventing potential confusion from less specific errors that might have occurred later in the process. This change does not affect data processing if the client initializes successfully.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
