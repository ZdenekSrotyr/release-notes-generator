_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.11](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.11)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved Vector Client Error Handling
Enhanced error handling provides more informative messages for vector client connection issues during component setup.

We've refined the error reporting mechanism for components that utilize vector databases, such as Qdrant. Previously, if a connection attempt failed during the initialization phase, the original technical exception was surfaced, which could sometimes be unclear.

With this update, if the system encounters issues while initializing the vector client (e.g., cannot connect to the database), it will now raise a specific `UserException`. This provides clearer, more user-friendly feedback, making it easier to diagnose and troubleshoot connection problems during component configuration. This change focuses solely on improving error reporting during setup and does not alter core functionalities like embedding generation or data processing.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
