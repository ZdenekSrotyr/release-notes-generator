**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved Error Handling for Vector Client Setup
Get clearer feedback and prevent unexpected crashes with enhanced error reporting during vector client initialization.

We've improved the stability of components utilizing vector clients during their initialization phase.

Previously, issues like invalid credentials or connection problems during the vector client setup could lead to unclear errors or component crashes. Now, if the initialization fails, the component will raise a specific `UserException` with a descriptive message, clearly indicating the problem.

This change prevents the component from attempting to process data with a faulty setup, leading to a more predictable and user-friendly experience. Your data processing logic remains unaffected when the vector client initializes successfully. This enhancement makes troubleshooting setup issues easier and ensures more robust component execution.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
