**Stage:** PRIVATE


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Clearer Feedback for Vector DB Connection Errors

**Excerpt:** Receive more specific error messages if the vector database client fails to initialize in the embeddings component.

**Post detail:**
We have refined the error handling within the embeddings component, specifically during the initialization phase of the vector database client. Previously, configuration issues like invalid credentials or incorrect endpoints might result in a less specific error.

Now, if the component cannot successfully connect to your vector database upon starting, it will raise a more informative `UserException`. This provides clearer, actionable feedback directly indicating a problem with the vector database connection details. This change prevents the component from attempting to process data with an invalid setup, ensuring more robust operation and easier troubleshooting.

This update focuses solely on the initial connection and error reporting. The core data processing logic of the embeddings component remains unchanged if the connection to the vector database is successful.



## Changes:



- Add catch error from initializing the vector client 




- PR #13 




- Update version 




- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main'
