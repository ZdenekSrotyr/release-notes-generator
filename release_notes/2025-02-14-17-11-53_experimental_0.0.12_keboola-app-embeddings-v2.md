**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Component Update: Streamlined Connection & Retries
Updated Pinecone authentication method and implemented automatic retries for upsert operations to improve stability.

We have updated the way our component connects to the Pinecone vector database service. The initialization process has been modified within the `PineconeVectorDBClient` class: the `username` parameter and the explicit `pinecone.init` call have been removed. Instead, the `api_key` and `environment` parameters are now passed directly to the `Pinecone` constructor, streamlining the authentication process.

Additionally, we have implemented retry logic for Pinecone upsert operations within the `_process_single_table` method. If the component encounters a rate limiting error (HTTP 429) while writing data, it will now automatically wait and retry the upsert operation multiple times. This enhancement increases the resilience of data uploads to Pinecone, reducing failures caused by temporary API rate limits.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
