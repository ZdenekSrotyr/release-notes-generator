#  keboola.app-embeddings-v2 0.0.12

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.12](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.12)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Improved Component Reliability and Authentication

**Excerpt:** The Embeddings V2 component features enhanced error handling for retries and updated authentication.

**Post detail:**
We've updated the Embeddings V2 component for improved stability and connectivity.

Error handling during processing has been refined within `component_embeddings_v2/run.py`. The component now specifically identifies and handles `RetryError` exceptions that occur only after all retry attempts for underlying operations have been exhausted. This leads to more accurate error reporting and improves the robustness of pipeline executions when encountering repeated failures.

Additionally, the authentication process for interacting with the Keboola Storage API has been updated in `component_embeddings_v2/keboola_client.py`. The username format used internally now correctly incorporates both the stack ID and project ID (`{kbc_stack_id}:{kbc_project_id}`), ensuring reliable API connections. This change affects authentication and does not alter the core embedding calculation logic.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
