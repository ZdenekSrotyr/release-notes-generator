_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.12](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.12)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Reliability for OpenAI Component
Our OpenAI component update improves reliability with better rate limit handling and refines user identification for OpenAI API calls.

This update introduces improvements to our OpenAI integration component (version 0.0.12) to enhance its robustness and metadata handling during data processing.

Firstly, we've refined how user information is communicated to OpenAI. The component configuration now uses `user_id` instead of `username`. This `user_id` is passed directly to the OpenAI API's `user` parameter when generating embeddings. While this doesn't change the generated embeddings, it ensures accurate user metadata is associated with your API requests on OpenAI's side.

Secondly, error handling during processing has been improved. The component now specifically detects `RateLimitError` responses from the OpenAI API. When a rate limit is encountered, the component will pause briefly before automatically retrying the request, leading to smoother processing and increased resilience, especially under high load conditions.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
