**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Handling for OpenAI Embeddings
We've refined the OpenAI embedding component for clearer error messages and improved internal monitoring.

We have implemented improvements to components utilizing OpenAI for generating embeddings. These changes focus on enhancing reliability and providing clearer feedback during operation.

Firstly, we've added specific error handling for invalid OpenAI API keys. If the component encounters an `invalid_api_key` error during an API call, it will now raise a dedicated `UserException`. This provides a much clearer indication that the issue lies with the API key configuration, allowing for faster troubleshooting compared to previous generic error messages.

Secondly, we have adjusted the format of the `user` identifier sent to OpenAI as part of the request metadata. This change is purely for internal monitoring and usage tracking purposes by OpenAI and Keboola. It does not impact the text being embedded or the resulting embedding vectors themselves. Your data and the core functionality remain unchanged.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
