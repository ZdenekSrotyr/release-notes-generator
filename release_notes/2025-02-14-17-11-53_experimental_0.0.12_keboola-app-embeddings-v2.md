#  keboola.app-embeddings-v2 0.0.12

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.12](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.12)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved Resilience Against OpenAI Rate Limits
Our component now automatically retries when encountering OpenAI API rate limits, ensuring smoother data processing.

We've enhanced the error handling within our data processing components that interact with the OpenAI API. Specifically, the retry mechanism in the `_process_batch` method (`src/component.py`) has been updated to explicitly recognize and handle `openai.RateLimitError`.

This update significantly improves the component's resilience. Previously, encountering an OpenAI rate limit could cause processing to fail. Now, the component will automatically attempt to retry the data batch, increasing the likelihood of successful completion even when facing temporary API limitations. This leads to more robust and reliable data processing pipelines.

## Configuration Update: Username Field Format
The format type for the `authorization.workspace.credentials.username` field in the configuration definition has been updated.

We've made a minor adjustment to the configuration definition (`src/config_def.json`). The `format` type for the `authorization.workspace.credentials.username` field has been changed from `password` to `text`.

This change primarily affects how this field might be displayed or handled within configuration user interfaces. It does not alter the underlying functionality or how the provided username is used during component execution. Your data processing logic remains unaffected by this update.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
