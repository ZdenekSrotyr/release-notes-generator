## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component Now More Robust: Validation & Retries Enhanced
Enhanced validation and retry mechanisms boost the reliability of the Embeddings component.

We've rolled out updates to the Embeddings component focused on enhancing configuration validation and operational robustness.

To prevent configuration errors early, we've introduced username format validation. The component now strictly checks if the `username` provided in the configuration credentials adheres to a standard email-like format. Processing will halt during startup if the format is invalid, ensuring your configuration is correct before any data processing commences and improving overall pipeline reliability.

Additionally, we've bolstered the component's resilience against transient API issues. The retry logic for calls to both Azure OpenAI and Google Vertex AI services has been improved. Retries will now also be triggered for specific connection errors (`openai.APIConnectionError` for Azure) and service unavailability errors (`google.api_core.exceptions.ServiceUnavailable` for Vertex AI). This enhancement increases the likelihood of successful job completion by automatically handling temporary external service disruptions, leading to smoother and more reliable embedding generation. Updates to internal error handling further contribute to the component's overall stability.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
