#  keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings 0.0.12

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.12](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.12)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced OpenAI Embedding Reliability
OpenAI embedding generation is now more resilient to transient API errors through improved retry logic.

We have updated the error handling mechanism for generating embeddings using the OpenAI API. Previously, the system would only retry API calls upon receiving specific `RateLimitError` or `ServiceUnavailableError` responses.

The retry logic has now been expanded to include `openai.error.APIError`. This change increases the robustness of the embedding generation process by attempting retries on a wider range of temporary API issues encountered with OpenAI. This enhancement improves the overall success rate of pipelines relying on OpenAI embeddings without altering the content of successfully generated embeddings.

## Component Metadata Update: Username Format
The username format used during component initialization has been updated, potentially affecting run identification metadata.

An internal change has been made to the format of the `username` string used when initializing a component (`Component` class). A prefix is now added to this string.

This modification affects metadata and logging associated with component runs and might be relevant for tracking or identifying runs in external systems. This update does not impact how component processes input data or generates output.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
