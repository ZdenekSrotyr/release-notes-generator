#  keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings 0.0.12

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.12](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.12)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Embeddings Component Now More Resilient

**Excerpt:** The Embeddings component automatically retries processing when facing temporary issues, ensuring smoother operation.

**Post Detail:**
We've enhanced the Embeddings component to be more robust against temporary network or service issues. It now incorporates retry logic, allowing it to automatically re-attempt processing if it encounters specific transient errors. This increases the likelihood of successful job completion without manual intervention.

Additionally, we've refined the internal error handling structure for better diagnostics. User information retrieved from Keboola Connection, often used in logs or metadata, now includes the user ID alongside the name for improved clarity.

These changes focus on improving the reliability and maintainability of the component. The core logic for generating embeddings remains unchanged.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
