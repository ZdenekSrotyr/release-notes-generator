## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Update: Improved API Resilience
Enhancements to component resilience and Keboola API interactions for improved stability.

This update focuses on internal improvements to enhance component stability and interaction with the Keboola platform APIs. While there are no changes to the core data processing logic, such as how embeddings are calculated or data is transformed, we've refined how the component handles certain API communications.

Specifically, we've adjusted the retry mechanism for Keboola API calls. Retries due to a `RuntimeError` will now only occur if the error specifically relates to a username conflict ("USERNAME_ALREADY_EXISTS"), leading to more targeted error handling and improved resilience in specific scenarios.

Additionally, the format used for generating the username when requesting Keboola API tokens has been updated for better identification and standardization.

These behind-the-scenes changes contribute to a more robust and stable component experience without altering its primary data processing functions.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
