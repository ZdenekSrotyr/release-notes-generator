**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.12](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.12)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Embedding Resilience & Snowflake Configuration
Key component updates improve embedding generation reliability and allow more characters in Snowflake usernames during setup.

We have implemented updates to enhance component functionality and flexibility.

Firstly, the resilience of embedding generation has been improved. The system will now make one additional attempt to generate embeddings when encountering transient errors from the embedding service before failing. This increases the likelihood of successful data processing during intermittent service issues.

Secondly, the validation for Snowflake usernames during configuration has been expanded. Usernames containing the characters `$`, `[`, `]`, `"`, space, and `-` are now permitted. This change affects only the configuration validation process and does not alter how table data is processed.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
