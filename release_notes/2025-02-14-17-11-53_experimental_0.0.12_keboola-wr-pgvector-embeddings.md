## Change log (AI generated):
## OpenAI Component Update: Faster Error Handling & Enhanced Tracking
This update improves OpenAI component reliability by handling authentication errors faster and enhances API call tracking.

We've rolled out enhancements to our OpenAI components focusing on improved error handling and better operational tracking.

First, we've modified how the component handles authentication errors during batch processing. If an `openai.RateLimitError` with a `401 Unauthorized` status occurs, the component will now fail immediately without attempting retries. This change prevents unnecessary processing attempts and potential costs when API authentication fails, ensuring you are notified of configuration issues more quickly.

Second, for improved monitoring and tracking purposes, the `username` parameter sent with API calls to OpenAI is now consistently formatted as `project_id-app_id-run_id`. This standardized format helps in identifying requests associated with specific Keboola runs. Importantly, this change only affects the metadata sent alongside the request and does not alter your input data or the resulting embeddings.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
