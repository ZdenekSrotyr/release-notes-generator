_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.12](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.12)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Smoother OpenAI Embedding Generation

Generate OpenAI embeddings more reliably with enhanced network error handling.

We've enhanced the robustness of our OpenAI embedding generation components to provide a more seamless experience. The process is now more resilient to transient network issues that can occur when communicating with the OpenAI API.

Previously, automatic retries were only triggered for rate limit errors. We have now added connection errors (`APIConnectionError`) to the list of exceptions that prompt an automatic retry. This update increases the likelihood of successfully generating embeddings even when temporary network glitches occur, reducing job failures compared to before.

Additionally, we've slightly modified the format of the user identifier sent with API requests to OpenAI (from `run_id` to `run_id:{run_id}`) for improved tracking and moderation purposes on their end. This change impacts only metadata sent to OpenAI and does not affect your input data or the resulting embedding vectors.

These updates contribute to a smoother and more dependable experience when generating OpenAI embeddings within Keboola.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
