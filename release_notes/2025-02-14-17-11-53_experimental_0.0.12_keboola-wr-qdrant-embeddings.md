## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings V2 Component Update: Resilience and Context Improvements
The Embeddings V2 component now features broader API error retry logic for enhanced resilience and sends updated user information in metadata.

We've released an update for the Embeddings V2 component focusing on improved robustness and metadata clarity during the embedding generation process.

This version enhances the component's resilience when interacting with the external embedding API. Previously, retries were triggered only by specific, predefined errors. Now, the component will attempt to retry API calls upon encountering a wider range of general exceptions (`Exception` class). This change aims to better handle transient network or API issues, potentially leading to more successful embedding jobs without manual intervention. We recommend monitoring component runs, as this broader retry mechanism might occasionally mask persistent underlying problems.

Additionally, we've refined the user metadata sent with each API request. The format now includes the user ID and email (`ID - Email`) instead of just the username, providing clearer contextual information to the embedding service for tracking and potential debugging purposes. This update only affects the metadata sent alongside your data; the actual text content submitted for embedding remains unchanged.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
