## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced OpenAI Error Handling for Embeddings Component
The OpenAI Embeddings component now handles transient API errors more effectively, improving job reliability.

We have updated the OpenAI Embeddings component to enhance its interaction with the OpenAI API. Error handling has been refined to differentiate between potentially temporary server issues (like HTTP 500 or 503 errors) and other API errors.

This change improves robustness, as the component can now automatically retry requests that fail due to transient OpenAI problems, increasing the likelihood of successful job completion. Conversely, jobs encountering non-retryable API errors may now fail faster, providing quicker feedback.

Additionally, an internal metadata key within the component's state file has been updated from `username` to `kbc_username`. This internal adjustment does not affect the component's core functionality or your input/output data tables.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
