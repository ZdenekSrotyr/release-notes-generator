**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved Reliability for Pinecone Destination
The Pinecone destination now automatically retries failed data upsert operations, increasing the success rate of writing embedding vectors.

We have implemented enhancements to the Pinecone destination within our embedding components to improve operational stability.

The primary change introduces automatic retry logic for the vector `upsert` operation. If an attempt to write embedding vectors to your Pinecone index fails due to a transient issue, the operation will now be automatically retried. This significantly increases the likelihood that your data will be successfully stored without manual intervention.

Additionally, similar retry mechanisms have been added to the Pinecone index `create` and `delete` operations, making the setup and teardown processes for your Pinecone resources more robust against temporary failures. We have also updated how Pinecone API credentials are accessed, now using a more secure method, and upgraded the underlying `pinecone-client` library to version 3.2.0. These changes contribute to the overall reliability and security of the Pinecone destination component.
