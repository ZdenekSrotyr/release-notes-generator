**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.12](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.12)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Reliability for AI Embedding Connections
We've refined connection handling for OpenAI and Vertex AI embedding components to improve reliability and authentication flexibility.

We've implemented several backend improvements to enhance the stability and flexibility of our AI embedding components when connecting to third-party services like OpenAI and Google Vertex AI. While these changes don't alter the core embedding generation logic or the final output, they contribute to a smoother and more reliable user experience.

For OpenAI connections, we've made our automatic retry mechanism smarter. It now targets specific connection errors more precisely, improving robustness during embedding batch processing. We've also adjusted how authentication is handled when connecting to Azure OpenAI, prioritizing API key usage if provided.

For Vertex AI connections, we've updated the client initialization to better support authentication using service account JSON key files, offering more flexibility beyond relying solely on Application Default Credentials.

These adjustments ensure more resilient connections and handle different authentication configurations more effectively, contributing to the overall stability of your data pipelines involving AI embeddings.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
