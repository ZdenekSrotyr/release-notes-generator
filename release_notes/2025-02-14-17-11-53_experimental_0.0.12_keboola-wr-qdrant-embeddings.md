#  keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings 0.0.12

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.12](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.12)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Fix: Embeddings Component Authentication
We've corrected the username format used by our embeddings component, resolving potential authentication issues with external services.

We have identified and fixed an issue where the component responsible for generating embeddings might have encountered authentication problems with the external service. This was due to an incorrect format in the generated username string used for identification.

Specifically, hyphens (`-`) previously used as separators between the project ID, token ID, and stack ID have been replaced with underscores (`_`). This alignment ensures the component correctly authenticates and can successfully retrieve embeddings, allowing your data processing pipelines to run smoothly.

This change solely addresses the authentication mechanism and does not alter the underlying embedding generation process or the resulting data. No action is required on your part.

## Improved Log Clarity for Chunk Processing
Component error logs for chunk processing retries now use more intuitive 1-based indexing for easier debugging.

To enhance the user experience when troubleshooting component runs, we've adjusted how error messages related to chunk processing retries are logged.

Previously, if a component failed while processing a specific chunk of data and then retried, the log message might refer to the chunk using a 0-based index (e.g., "chunk 0"). We've updated these messages to use a 1-based index (e.g., "chunk 1"), which is generally more intuitive for users.

This change makes logs easier to read and understand but has no impact on the component's functionality, the data processing logic, or the final output.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
