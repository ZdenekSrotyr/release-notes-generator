#  keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings 0.0.12

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.12](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.12)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Improved Resilience for OpenAI Component
**Excerpt:** The OpenAI component now automatically retries connections, improving reliability during processing.
**Post detail:**
We've enhanced the retry logic for initializing connections to the OpenAI API. The component will now automatically retry up to five times if it encounters specific connection issues (`APIConnectionError`) or rate limits (`RateLimitError`) during startup.
This uses an exponential backoff strategy, starting with a 1-second delay and increasing up to a maximum of 10 seconds between attempts. This improvement increases the component's resilience to temporary network problems or high OpenAI API load, making successful embedding generation more likely without requiring manual intervention. The actual data processing and embedding results remain unchanged.

**Title:** Keboola User ID Now Sent to OpenAI
**Excerpt:** OpenAI API calls now use your Keboola User ID for identification and tracking purposes.
**Post detail:**
The identifier sent to the OpenAI API when making requests has been updated. The component now uses your Keboola User ID (`#keboola.userId`) as the `user` parameter, retrieved from image parameters.
Previously, a different configuration parameter might have been used. This change enhances how OpenAI tracks and monitors API usage for purposes like abuse detection, associating requests directly with the Keboola user. It does not affect the input text being processed or the resulting embedding vectors.
