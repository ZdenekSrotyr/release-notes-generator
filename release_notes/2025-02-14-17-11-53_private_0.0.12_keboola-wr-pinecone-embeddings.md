## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Enhanced Component Error Handling and Configuration Update

**Excerpt:** Components now feature improved retry logic for better reliability, alongside an update to username field handling.

**Post detail:**
We've updated the error handling logic within components, specifically how transient errors are managed through retries. This enhancement increases the robustness of component execution, making them more likely to complete successfully even when facing temporary issues like intermittent network problems. This may result in more complete output data in scenarios that previously might have led to failures.

Additionally, the requirements or handling related to the 'username' field, typically used in configuration or authentication, have been modified. This change impacts component setup and connection parameters but does not alter the core data transformation logic. Ensure your configurations align with any updated requirements.



## Changes:



- Fix retry error 




- Update version 




- try wf 




- Edit Workflow to run only for changes in paths in branch and if it runs under tag
