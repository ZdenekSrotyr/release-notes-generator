**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Accurate Embeddings Results on Retry
Updated retry logic in the embeddings component ensures data accuracy when processing text chunks.

We have improved the reliability of the text embeddings component, specifically addressing how results are handled during automatic retry attempts.

Previously, if a temporary network or API error caused a retry while processing text chunks, results from successfully processed chunks within the *failed* attempt could potentially be carried over. This could lead to duplicated or incorrectly combined results when the operation eventually succeeded on a subsequent retry.

The component now resets the collected results at the beginning of each retry attempt. This change guarantees that only the embedding results from the single, ultimately successful processing attempt for a given batch of text are stored, preventing data duplication and ensuring the integrity of your embedding results.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
