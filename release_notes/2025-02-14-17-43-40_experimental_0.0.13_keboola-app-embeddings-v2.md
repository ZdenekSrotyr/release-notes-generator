**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced API Call Resilience
Behind-the-scenes code improvements enhance how our platform handles API retries for increased reliability.

We've rolled out internal updates focused on improving the stability and robustness of interactions with external APIs, such as the OpenAI service used by some components.

Our team has refined the logic that handles retrying API calls when errors occur. The system now better identifies specific issues like rate limits (HTTP 429) or temporary server errors (HTTP 500+) before attempting a retry. This leads to smarter, more efficient retries and increases the overall resilience of components relying on these APIs. We have also improved the internal code structure related to how API clients are managed.

These enhancements are focused on internal code quality and operational stability. They do not change how your data is processed or introduce new user-facing features, but contribute to a smoother and more reliable platform experience.



## Changes:
