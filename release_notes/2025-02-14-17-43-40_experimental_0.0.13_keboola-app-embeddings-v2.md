**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced OpenAI Embedding Reliability
We've improved the retry mechanism for OpenAI embeddings to better handle rate limits, ensuring more robust data processing.

We have implemented a significant improvement to the batch embedding process when using OpenAI models. This update addresses how `openai.RateLimitError` exceptions are handled to increase processing stability.

Previously, encountering an OpenAI rate limit error after the initial attempt could lead to that specific data batch being skipped. The corrected logic now ensures that the system automatically retries processing the *same* batch multiple times, with delays between attempts, before skipping it.

This enhancement significantly improves the robustness of the embedding feature. Data batches facing transient OpenAI rate limits are now much more likely to be successfully processed and embedded, leading to more complete and reliable results in your projects.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
