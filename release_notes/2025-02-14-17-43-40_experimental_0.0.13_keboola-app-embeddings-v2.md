#  keboola.app-embeddings-v2 0.0.13

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## More Robust Embedding Generation Retries
We've enhanced the retry mechanism for embedding generation to handle a broader range of transient API issues.

The component responsible for generating embeddings has been updated to improve its resilience against temporary API problems. Previously, the retry loop for fetching embeddings only caught `ApiConnectionError`.

We have now expanded this logic to also catch `APIError`. This means the component will attempt to retry the operation not only on connection failures but also on other API-related errors, such as potential rate limiting or temporary server-side issues reported as `APIError`. This change increases the likelihood of successfully completing embedding generation tasks when transient API disruptions occur.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
