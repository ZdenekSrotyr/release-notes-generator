_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Enhanced Reliability for OpenAI Embeddings

Excerpt: Improved retry timing enhances success rates when generating OpenAI embeddings under rate limits.

Post detail:
We have refined the retry mechanism used when encountering OpenAI rate limits during the embedding generation process. The logic within the exception handler for `openai.RateLimitError` has been adjusted.

Specifically, the increment of the retry counter now occurs *after* the timed delay (exponential backoff). This ensures the intended pause is fully completed before logging the attempt, correcting the backoff timing. This change increases the likelihood of successfully generating embeddings when OpenAI rate limits are temporarily exceeded.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
