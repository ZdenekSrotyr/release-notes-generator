#  keboola.app-embeddings-v2 0.0.13

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced API Call Reliability

Corrected API retry handling ensures more consistent and reliable component performance during transient errors.

We've deployed an update to refine the API call retry mechanism within our components. Previously, the retry count and delay could be unintentionally shared between different API calls made by the same component instance, potentially affecting subsequent operations after an initial failure.

This fix ensures that each API call manages its retry attempts independently, using its own count and exponential backoff delay. This leads to more robust and predictable behavior, particularly improving the reliability of fetching embedding data when temporary API issues occur. Your components will now handle transient errors more gracefully, ensuring smoother data processing.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
