**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Retry Mechanism Fix Ensures Correct Argument Passing
Corrected the retry mechanism to ensure functions maintain their original arguments during retry attempts, improving operational reliability.

We have addressed an issue in the platform's internal retry logic. Previously, when an operation decorated for automatic retries encountered a failure, subsequent retry attempts might not have included the original parameters or data initially provided to the function.

This fix ensures that all necessary arguments are correctly passed during each retry attempt. This improves the reliability of processes that utilize this retry mechanism, preventing potential failures or unexpected results caused by missing parameters during retries, especially under transient error conditions.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
