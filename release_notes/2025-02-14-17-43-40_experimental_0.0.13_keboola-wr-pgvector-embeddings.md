## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings: Improved Tracking of API Failures
Get more accurate failure tracking for embedding generation when API calls encounter issues.

We've enhanced the error handling within our embedding generation component to provide more reliable failure tracking. This update specifically addresses scenarios where API calls fail during the embedding process.

Previously, if an API call for a batch of rows failed, the recording of which rows failed was linked to the retry attempt. This could lead to incomplete failure logs if the retry also failed, potentially for different reasons. Now, when an initial API call for a batch fails, all rows within that batch are immediately marked as failed *before* any retry is attempted.

This change ensures you receive a complete and accurate record of all input rows that could not be processed due to API errors, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot problematic data. The calculation process for successful embeddings remains unaffected.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
