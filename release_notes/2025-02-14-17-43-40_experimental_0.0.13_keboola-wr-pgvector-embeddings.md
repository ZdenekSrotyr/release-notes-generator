**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Error Retry Logic Refined

Excerpt: Error handling logic updated for more precise retry management during batch processing.

Post detail:
We've refined the error handling mechanism within component batch processing. Specifically, the timing for incrementing the retry counter during API errors has been adjusted within the internal processing logic.

This change ensures that the retry count reflects the attempt immediately when an error is caught, occurring before any subsequent pause or backoff calculation. While this adjustment does not affect the final data content, it enhances the accuracy of logging and provides a clearer view of the execution flow when errors occur, leading to more precise monitoring of retry behavior.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
