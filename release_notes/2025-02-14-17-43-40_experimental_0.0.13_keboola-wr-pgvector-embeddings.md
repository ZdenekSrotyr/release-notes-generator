#  keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings 0.0.13

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Optimized Embedding API Rate Limit Retries
We've adjusted the retry mechanism for the embedding API when rate limits are encountered, switching to a constant delay for improved handling.

We have updated the retry strategy within the `process_batch` function specifically for handling `openai.RateLimitError` encountered during embedding operations. Previously, retries for this specific error utilized an exponential backoff delay, meaning the wait time increased significantly with each retry attempt.

This has now been replaced with a constant delay for subsequent retries immediately following an `openai.RateLimitError`. This adjustment modifies the timing behavior when interacting with the embedding API under rate-limiting conditions. While it does not alter the content of the generated embeddings themselves, it may influence the overall processing time and batch success rate if rate limits are frequently encountered.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
