**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinpoint Encoding Issues Faster with Enhanced Logs
Enhanced logging now includes batch shape and size to help you identify the root cause of encoding errors faster.

Troubleshooting batch encoding errors just got easier. We've enhanced our logging messages to include specific details about the batch shape and size whenever an encoding attempt fails, both on the initial try and during retries.

This additional context provides greater observability into your processes, allowing you to more quickly diagnose issues related to specific batch structures or sizes. This change improves debugging capabilities without altering the core data processing logic or how errors are handled.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
