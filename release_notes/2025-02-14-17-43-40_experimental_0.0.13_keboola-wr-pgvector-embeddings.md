#  keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings 0.0.13

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Reliability for Embedding Generation
We've enhanced the retry mechanism for embedding generation, ensuring greater processing reliability.

We have implemented an update to improve the robustness of embedding generation processes within the platform. This addresses a specific bug related to how transient API errors were handled during retry attempts.

Previously, under certain conditions, the retry loop for API calls might not have executed correctly after an initial failure. This update corrects the internal logic, ensuring that temporary API communication issues are handled more effectively. This enhancement increases the likelihood of successful embedding generation for all input data rows, preventing potential failures or incomplete processing caused by retry logic errors.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
