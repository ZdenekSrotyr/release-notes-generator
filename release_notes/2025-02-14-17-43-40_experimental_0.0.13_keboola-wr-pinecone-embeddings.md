**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Smoother OpenAI Interactions: Automatic Rate Limit Retries
Our components using OpenAI now automatically retry upon hitting API rate limits, enhancing processing reliability.

We've improved how our components interact with OpenAI APIs, specifically concerning rate limits. We've implemented more specific error handling that automatically triggers retry attempts when an `openai.RateLimitError` occurs during data processing.

This update significantly boosts the reliability of tasks like generating embeddings. Instead of potentially failing when the OpenAI API is temporarily busy or rate limits are encountered, the component will now intelligently wait and retry according to a predefined backoff strategy.

This leads to more robust and resilient data pipelines, reducing interruptions and ensuring your jobs using OpenAI services complete more consistently, even during periods of high API usage.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
