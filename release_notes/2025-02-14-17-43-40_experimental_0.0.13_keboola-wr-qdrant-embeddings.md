**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Validation: Skipping Rows with Missing Primary Keys
Component processing now skips rows lacking primary key values, ensuring smoother runs and improved handling of transient API errors.

We have updated component processing to enhance data validation and error handling.

Input rows are now validated to ensure a value exists in the specified primary key column. If a row lacks a primary key value, a `MissingPrimaryKeyValue` error is raised internally. During batch processing, this specific error is caught; the problematic row is skipped, a warning is logged detailing the skipped row, and the component continues to process the remaining valid rows in the batch. This prevents rows with missing primary keys from halting the process or being processed incorrectly downstream.

Additionally, the component's API request retry logic has been refined. It now includes specific handling for `requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout`, `openai.RateLimitError`, and `openai.APIConnectionError`, increasing robustness against these transient API issues and improving the likelihood of successful completion during temporary disruptions.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
