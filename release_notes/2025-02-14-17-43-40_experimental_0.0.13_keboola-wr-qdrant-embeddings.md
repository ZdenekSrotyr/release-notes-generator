**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Smarter Retries for OpenAI Rate Limits
Our OpenAI components now handle rate limits more intelligently by using suggested wait times directly from the OpenAI API.

We've updated how our OpenAI components manage retries when encountering rate limits (`openai.RateLimitError`). This adjustment focuses specifically on the timing of retry attempts.

Previously, the component might have used a less specific delay when retrying after a rate limit error. Now, it actively parses the error message returned by the OpenAI API to find the suggested waiting period before the next attempt. This ensures the component adheres more closely to OpenAI's guidance, leading to more efficient processing during high-load periods and potentially reducing overall wait times caused by rate limiting.

This change optimizes behavior under specific error conditions (rate limiting) and does not alter the core data processing, embedding calculations, or the final output data upon successful completion.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
