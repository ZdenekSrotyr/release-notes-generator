## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Generator: Enhanced Text Processing and Reliability
Enhanced text cleaning and more reliable API retries improve the Embeddings Generator's performance.

The Embeddings Generator component now automatically removes null bytes (`\x00`) from input text strings before sending them to the embedding API. This enhancement, alongside the existing replacement of newline characters with spaces, prevents potential processing errors and allows for successful embedding generation from text data that previously might have failed due to these characters.

Reliability during communication with the external embedding service has also been improved. The component now explicitly re-initializes the API client configuration (API key and base URL) before retrying a failed API call, ensuring the correct settings are used for the second attempt. Additionally, exception handling during these retries has been broadened to catch a wider range of potential issues, improving overall robustness and error reporting for transient API problems.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
