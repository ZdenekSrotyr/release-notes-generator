**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Handling in Embeddings Component
We've refined the API error retry logic within the embeddings component for improved resilience and consistent behaviour during repeated failures.

We have implemented an enhancement to the error handling mechanism within our embeddings component, focusing on API communication stability.

This update specifically modifies how the component processes and logs API errors during the later stages of its retry sequence, particularly affecting the third and any subsequent retry attempts.

While the core embedding generation logic and the total number of retries performed remain unchanged under normal operation, this adjustment ensures more consistent behaviour when dealing with persistent API communication issues. This refinement improves the component's resilience and predictability during prolonged error conditions.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
