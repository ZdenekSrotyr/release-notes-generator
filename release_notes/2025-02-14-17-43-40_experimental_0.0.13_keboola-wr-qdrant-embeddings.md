#  keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings 0.0.13

_Released on 2025-02-14_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Reliability for Batch Processing Retries
Fixed an issue ensuring results from successful embedding batch retries are correctly saved, preventing potential data loss.

We've addressed a specific issue within our batch processing logic related to retries. Previously, if an initial attempt to process a batch (e.g., for generating embeddings) failed due to a transient error, but a subsequent retry succeeded, the results from that successful retry might have been inadvertently discarded.

This update corrects the result handling logic within the retry mechanism. Now, if a retry successfully processes a batch, its results are properly collected and included in the final output. This ensures greater data completeness and reliability, especially in environments prone to intermittent network or service issues, preventing the loss of successfully generated embedding data.

## Improved Accuracy in Processing Progress Tracking
Updated component state tracking to more accurately reflect processing progress, especially when errors occur during batch operations.

We've refined how components track their progress, specifically concerning the `last_processed_row_index` variable. This internal marker indicates how far processing has advanced within a dataset.

The adjustment ensures this index correctly reflects the last successfully processed row, even if an entire subsequent batch fails. While this change doesn't alter the primary data output (like embeddings), it significantly improves the reliability of the component's state information. This leads to more accurate progress monitoring and potentially more robust recovery behavior in workflows sensitive to component state.
