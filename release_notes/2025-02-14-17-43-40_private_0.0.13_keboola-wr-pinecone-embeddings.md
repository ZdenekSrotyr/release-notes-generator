**Component:** [keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.13](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.13)  
**Stage:** PRIVATE


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Optimized OpenAI Rate Limit Retries

**Excerpt:** Refined retry logic for OpenAI API rate limits to avoid unnecessary delays when fetching embeddings.

**Post detail:**
We have improved the handling of OpenAI API rate limit errors (HTTP 429) encountered during the embeddings generation process.

Previously, the system would wait before every retry attempt, including the final one. The logic has been modified so that a wait only occurs if there are further retry attempts remaining. This prevents an unnecessary delay before the last attempt is made, potentially speeding up the component's execution when rate limits are hit, without changing the total number of retries.



## Changes:



- Fix the second retry bug
