## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Runner Stability: Stack ID Validation
The component runner now validates the Keboola stack ID before execution to prevent errors in unsupported environments.

To enhance the stability and predictability of component execution, we've added a validation step to the component runner. The runner now checks the provided Keboola stack ID (`KBC_STACK_ID`) at startup.

This pre-run check verifies that the runner is operating within one of the supported Keboola stacks (`aws-eu-central-1`, `aws-us-east-1`, `azure-westeurope`, `gcp-europe-west1`). If an unsupported stack ID is detected, the runner will exit immediately with an error message, preventing potential issues or unexpected behavior during data processing.

This change ensures components run reliably within designated environments without altering the core data processing logic when a valid stack is used.



## Changes:



- added valid stacks 




- Merged in fix/SUPPORT-10780 (pull request #4)
