## Change log (AI generated):
## Ensuring Compatibility: Components Now Validate Stack ID
Components now validate the Keboola stack they are running on, preventing execution in unsupported environments.

To enhance stability and ensure components operate correctly, we've introduced a validation step for the environment they run in. Components will now check the `KBC_STACK_ID` environment variable before starting execution.

This check verifies that the component is running on one of our officially supported Keboola stacks: `aws-eu-central-1`, `aws-us-east-1`, `azure-westeurope`, or `gcp-europe-west3`.

If a component is launched in an environment outside of these supported stacks, it will now terminate early with a clear error message. This preventative measure ensures that processing only occurs in environments where compatibility and performance are guaranteed. Your data processing logic remains unaffected when running on any supported stack.

- added valid stacks
