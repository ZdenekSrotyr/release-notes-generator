## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Enhanced Runner Stability: KBC_URL Validation

**Excerpt:** Component runners now verify the Keboola stack URL before execution to prevent configuration errors.

**Post detail:**
The component runner now includes a validation step for the `KBC_URL` environment variable during its initialization phase. This check enhances the reliability of component execution.

Specifically, the runner extracts the stack name from the provided `KBC_URL` and verifies it against a predefined list of supported Keboola stacks, currently including `azure.north-europe` and `aws.eu-central-1`.

If the `KBC_URL` is missing, incorrectly formatted, or points to a stack not on the supported list, the runner will now raise a `ConfigurationException` and terminate execution. This proactive check prevents components from attempting to run in invalid or unsupported environments, ensuring processes only start when correctly configured.
