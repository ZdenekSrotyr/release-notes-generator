## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Update: Stack-Specific Job Processing
Job processing logic now validates the cloud stack, processing only jobs from AWS, Azure, and GCP.

We have updated the job processing logic to include validation based on the associated cloud stack. This change ensures that only jobs originating from the AWS, Azure, or GCP stacks will be processed.

Jobs associated with any other cloud stack will now be skipped, and a corresponding warning will be logged. This refinement filters the processed jobs to align with supported cloud environments.



## Changes:



- added valid stacks 




- Merged in fix/SUPPORT-10780 (pull request #4)
