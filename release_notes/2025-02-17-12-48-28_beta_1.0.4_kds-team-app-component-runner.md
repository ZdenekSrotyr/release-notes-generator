## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Validation for Keboola Stack URLs
The component runner now validates the Keboola stack URL (KBC_URL) to prevent execution with invalid configurations.

We've introduced an enhancement to the component runner to improve environment validation. The runner now checks if the `KBC_URL` environment variable ends with one of the recognized Keboola stack URL suffixes: `.keboola.com`, `.keboola.co.uk`, or `.keboola.ca`.

If the provided `KBC_URL` does not match one of these valid suffixes, the component runner will now stop immediately and raise an error before executing the component's main logic. This ensures that components do not attempt to run against improperly configured or unrecognized Keboola environments.

This update serves as a preventative measure and does not change how your component's data processing logic operates when a valid `KBC_URL` is provided. It aims to improve the reliability of component execution by catching potential configuration issues early and providing clearer feedback.
