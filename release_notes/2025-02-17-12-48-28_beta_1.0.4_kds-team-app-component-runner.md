## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Component Configuration Validation
Prevent component run failures with early validation of the 'stack' configuration parameter.

We've enhanced the component runner to include validation for the `stack` configuration parameter. If this parameter is defined in a component's image configuration, the runner now checks its value before starting any data processing.

Only `aws` and `azure` are accepted as valid stack values. If an invalid value is supplied, the component execution will stop immediately with a `ValueError`. This proactive check prevents runs with incorrect configurations, improving overall stability and providing clearer feedback on setup issues. Data processing remains unaffected if the `stack` parameter is valid or not present.



## Changes:



- added valid stacks 




- Merged in fix/SUPPORT-10780 (pull request #4)
