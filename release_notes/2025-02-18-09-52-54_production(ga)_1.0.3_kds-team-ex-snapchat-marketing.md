## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Snapchat Ads Extractor: Granular Data & Incremental Loading
Get more detailed and up-to-date Snapchat Ads data with new time granularities and efficient incremental loading.

We've rolled out a significant update to the Snapchat Ads extractor, driven by extensive refactoring to enhance performance, reliability, and functionality.

Key improvements focus on the data extraction process itself. You can now fetch statistics reports with greater detail using new time granularity options: 'HOUR' and 'TOTAL' are now supported alongside the existing 'DAY' granularity. Furthermore, we've implemented incremental loading for statistics reports. This means the extractor now intelligently fetches only new or updated data since the last run, leading to faster and more efficient updates, especially for large accounts. Data integrity is also enhanced with added validation for API response data levels.

Under the hood, the extractor has been migrated to our latest component framework, streamlining its operation. The communication with the Snapchat API has been completely rewritten, incorporating robust authentication, improved pagination handling, and smarter error management (including respect for API rate limits via `Retry-After` headers). These changes contribute to more reliable and consistent data retrieval.

Additionally, new synchronous actions have been added to easily list available organizations and ad accounts directly within the Keboola interface, simplifying the component configuration process.
