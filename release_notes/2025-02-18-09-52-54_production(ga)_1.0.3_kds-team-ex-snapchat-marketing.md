## Change log (AI generated):
## Snapchat Extractor Update: Organization ID Now Required
The Snapchat extractor now requires an Organization ID, ensuring data is fetched only for the specified Snapchat Marketing Organization.

The Snapchat extractor has been updated with significant changes to improve data focus and reliability.

A key change is the introduction of a mandatory `organization_id` parameter in the component configuration. This parameter ensures the extractor retrieves data—including Ad Accounts, Campaigns, Ad Squads, Ads, and Statistics—exclusively for the single Snapchat Marketing Organization you specify. Previously, the extractor might have pulled data from all organizations accessible by your credentials. This change provides more precise control over the data extraction scope.

Additionally, the component's internal structure has been refactored using the standard `keboola.component` library framework. This modernization centralizes API communication logic (including authentication, pagination, rate limiting, and retries) into a dedicated client and introduces robust validation for API responses. These underlying improvements enhance the component's reliability, maintainability, and standardization when interacting with the Snapchat API.
