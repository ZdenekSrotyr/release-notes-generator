## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Snapchat Marketing: Filter Data by Organization ID

Excerpt: Focus your data extraction by filtering for a specific Snapchat Organization ID.

Post detail:
The Snapchat Marketing extractor has been updated. You can now specify an `organization_id` in the component configuration. When this parameter is used, the extractor will only fetch ad accounts and reporting data associated with that specific Snapchat Organization. If the parameter is left empty, the extractor retains its previous behavior, fetching data from all organizations accessible with the provided credentials. This allows for more targeted data extraction based on your specific needs.

Additionally, the component's internal structure has been significantly refactored to utilize the latest `keboola.component` framework. This modernization improves code organization and leverages updated mechanisms for configuration, state management, and logging, enhancing overall component robustness while maintaining the core data extraction functionality.
