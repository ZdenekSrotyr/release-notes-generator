## Snapchat Marketing Extractor: Now with Organization Filtering
Filter your Snapchat data extraction by selecting a specific Organization ID, ensuring you only process relevant accounts and campaigns.

We've updated the Snapchat Marketing extractor to give you more precise control over the data you pull into Keboola. The most significant enhancement is the new ability to filter data based on a specific Snapchat Organization ID.

If you manage multiple organizations under a single Snapchat account, you can now configure the extractor to fetch data *only* for the specific organization relevant to your project. This helps create more focused datasets, simplifies management for complex accounts, and can lead to more efficient data pipelines by processing only the necessary accounts, campaigns, ads, and statistics.

To use this feature, simply provide the desired `Organization ID` in the component configuration settings. You can still specify particular Ad Account IDs if needed, and they will be processed within the context of the selected organization. Additionally, we've improved the handling of date parameters with easier relative date options (like 'yesterday' or 'last_30_days') and added more flexibility for configuring statistics reports.
