## Change log (AI generated):
## Snapchat Ads Extractor Update: Target Specific Organizations

Filter your Snapchat Ads data by organization with the latest extractor update for focused insights and improved robustness.

We've updated the Snapchat Ads extractor to give you more control over the data you retrieve and enhance its reliability.

The most significant change is the introduction of mandatory organization-based filtering. You must now specify which Snapchat organizations you want to extract data from using the `organizations` parameter in the configuration. The component will fetch Ad Accounts exclusively associated with these selected organizations, ensuring you only process the data relevant to your needs. Previously, the extractor might have pulled data from all accessible accounts; this change allows for a more focused and potentially faster extraction process.

Alongside this, we've improved error handling:
*   **Invalid Report Dimensions:** If Snapchat flags a report dimension as invalid, the extractor will now log a warning and continue processing other reports and accounts, rather than failing completely. This means you'll still get data from valid reports, although rows related to the invalid one will be missing.
*   **API Rate Limiting:** When encountering Snapchat API rate limits, the component will automatically retry using an exponential backoff strategy. This significantly increases the likelihood of successful data extraction, even during periods of high API usage.

Finally, the component's underlying structure has been refactored using the standard `keboola.component` library for better maintainability and consistency. While this primarily affects the codebase internally, you might notice minor differences in output file formatting due to the standardized CSV handling. The core data extraction logic remains the same, apart from the new organization filtering.
