## Change log (AI generated):
## Snapchat Extractor: Organization-Level Data Scoping Now Available
Fetch Snapchat data scoped by specific organizations or automatically discover all accessible ones for more precise data extraction.

Our Snapchat data extractor now supports Organization-level scoping. You can optionally provide a list of specific Snapchat `organization_ids` in the component configuration. When provided, the extractor will fetch data only for these designated organizations. If the parameter is left empty, the extractor automatically discovers and retrieves data for all organizations accessible via your credentials.

This update gives you explicit control over the scope of extracted data. Previously, data retrieval was implicitly based on accessible ad accounts. Now, it's tied directly to Snapchat Organizations, potentially altering the set of data you see depending on your configuration and credential permissions. All underlying API calls for statistics are now made within the context of a specific organization.

Additionally, a new sync action allows you to list available organizations directly within the Keboola interface, simplifying the configuration process for the new organization scoping feature.

Other improvements in this release include:
*   Refactoring the component to use the standard Keboola Component Framework, improving code structure and maintainability.
*   Updating the internal handling of API pagination for retrieving multi-page results.
*   Enhancing error handling with more specific exceptions for increased robustness.
