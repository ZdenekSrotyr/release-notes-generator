## Change log (AI generated):
## Smoother Component Runs: Now Checks for Existing Buckets
Components now verify destination bucket existence before creation, preventing potential setup errors and ensuring smoother runs.

We've enhanced the reliability of component execution during the initial setup phase.

Components will now automatically check if the designated destination bucket already exists in your Keboola Connection Storage before attempting to create it. If the bucket is found, the creation step is simply skipped, and the component proceeds.

This update prevents potential errors that could previously occur when a component tried to create a bucket that was already present. It ensures a smoother setup process, allowing subsequent operations, like table definition generation, to proceed without interruption and improving the overall robustness of your configurations.



## Changes:



- check for bucket existence before creation
