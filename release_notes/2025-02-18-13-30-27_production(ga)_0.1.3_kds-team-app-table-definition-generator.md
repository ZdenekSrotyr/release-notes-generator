## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Update: Enhanced Output Bucket Check
Components now verify output bucket existence before creation, improving setup reliability.

We've refined component behavior during the setup phase. Components now explicitly check if the designated output bucket already exists in Keboola Storage before attempting to create it.

This enhancement, implemented via a refactored internal method `_ensure_output_bucket_exists`, improves component robustness by correctly handling scenarios where the target bucket might already exist. It prevents potential errors or unnecessary API calls, ensuring a smoother setup before any data definitions are generated. This change focuses purely on setup reliability and does not affect the content or structure of the generated data.



## Changes:



- check for bucket existence before creation 




- Merged in fix/SUPPORT-10726 (pull request #5)
