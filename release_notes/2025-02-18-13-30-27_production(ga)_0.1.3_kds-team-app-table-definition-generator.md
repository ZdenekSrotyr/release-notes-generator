## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Reliability: Output Bucket Auto-Creation
Components now automatically create missing output buckets in Storage to prevent processing errors.

We've updated components involved in table definition generation to improve reliability when interacting with Keboola Connection Storage.

Previously, if the configured output bucket did not exist in Storage, the component might encounter an error later in the process when attempting to write results. This update introduces a preliminary check: before the main processing starts, the component verifies if the specified output bucket exists. If the bucket is not found (receiving a 404 error from the Storage API), the component now automatically attempts to create it.

This enhancement ensures the necessary output bucket is present before the component requires it, preventing runtime failures due to a missing destination. This change streamlines the setup process and improves robustness, without altering the core logic of how table definitions are generated.



## Changes:



- check for bucket existence before creation 




- Merged in fix/SUPPORT-10726 (pull request #5)
