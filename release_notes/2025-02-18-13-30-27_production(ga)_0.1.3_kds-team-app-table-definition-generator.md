## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Component Update Prevents Bucket Creation Errors

**Excerpt:** This update prevents component failures caused by pre-existing output buckets.

**Post detail:**
We've enhanced component execution to be more robust when dealing with output buckets. Components now automatically check if their designated target bucket already exists within your project before attempting to create it.

Previously, attempting to run a component targeting an existing bucket could result in a failure. With this change, the component will simply proceed if the bucket exists, preventing unnecessary errors and allowing your data processing tasks to complete successfully, even if the output bucket was provisioned beforehand. This improves reliability without affecting the component's core data processing logic or output.



## Changes:



- check for bucket existence before creation 




- Merged in fix/SUPPORT-10726 (pull request #5)
