## Change log (AI generated):
## Smoother Component Runs: Bucket Pre-Check Added
Components now verify bucket existence before creation, preventing potential errors and redundant API calls.

We've implemented an enhancement to improve the robustness of components interacting with Keboola Storage.

Components will now perform a check to verify if a target output bucket already exists within your project before attempting to create it. This small but important change prevents potential errors and avoids unnecessary API calls that could previously occur if a component tried to create a bucket that was already present.

This update enhances the reliability of component execution, particularly in workflows where output buckets might be pre-existing. It affects the component's interaction with the Storage API but does not alter the core logic of component operations, ensuring smoother and more predictable behavior.



## Changes:



- check for bucket existence before creation 




- Merged in fix/SUPPORT-10726 (pull request #5)
