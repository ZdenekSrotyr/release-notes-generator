## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved Reliability for Table Definition Generator
The Table Definition Generator component now avoids failures by checking if the target storage bucket exists before attempting creation.

We've released an update for the Table Definition Generator component to enhance its reliability during setup. Previously, the component could encounter an error if the specified target bucket already existed in your Keboola Storage before the component tried to create it.

With this update, the component now performs a check for the target bucket's existence first. If a bucket with the target name already exists, the component will use the existing bucket instead of attempting to create a duplicate. This change prevents run failures related to pre-existing buckets and ensures smoother operation, particularly in workflows where buckets might be managed or created outside the component's run.

This improvement focuses purely on the component's interaction with Storage buckets; the way table definitions are generated remains unchanged.



## Changes:



- check for bucket existence before creation 




- Merged in fix/SUPPORT-10726 (pull request #5)
