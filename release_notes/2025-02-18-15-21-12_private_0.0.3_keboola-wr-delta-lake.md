## Change log (AI generated):
## Expand Your Delta Lake: Write Directly to AWS S3 & GCS
Our Delta Lake Writer component now supports writing tables directly to AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage backends.

We've enhanced the Delta Lake Writer component to support writing Delta tables directly to cloud storage backends. You can now configure the writer to save your tables seamlessly to AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS), expanding beyond the previous default storage option.

This update offers greater flexibility for integrating Delta Lake with your preferred cloud storage provider. The target location is now determined by the connection parameters provided in the component configuration â€“ simply supply your AWS credentials (keys, region, token) or GCP service account information to direct the output.

Please note that as part of this update, the `writer_properties` parameter, which allowed passing specific configurations to the Delta writer, has been removed. Custom writer options previously set via this parameter will no longer be applied. We have also added specific error handling to provide clearer feedback if an unsupported storage provider is configured.



## Changes:



- added support for AWS + GCP 




- remove writer properties, raise user exception for unknown provider 




- flake8
