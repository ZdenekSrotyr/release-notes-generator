## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Component Gains AWS S3 and GCS Support
Read and write Delta Lake tables directly from AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

The Delta Lake component has been updated to enhance its flexibility and integration capabilities. You can now configure the component to read Delta Lake tables from, and write tables to, locations within AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS), in addition to the existing local filesystem support. New configuration parameters have been introduced to securely manage your cloud provider credentials and specify storage locations. This change enables seamless processing of Delta Lake data residing directly within your preferred cloud storage environment.

As part of this update, the option to configure custom `writer_properties` has been removed. The component will now utilize default Delta Lake writer behaviors, simplifying the configuration process. Fine-grained control previously offered by these properties is no longer available; writing behavior relies on defaults or other options like partitioning.

Additionally, error handling has been improved. The component now explicitly checks the configured storage provider type. If an unsupported provider (other than 'local', 'aws', or 'gcp') is specified, the component will fail early with a clear error message, preventing execution with invalid configurations.



## Changes:



- added support for AWS + GCP 




- remove writer properties, raise user exception for unknown provider 




- flake8
