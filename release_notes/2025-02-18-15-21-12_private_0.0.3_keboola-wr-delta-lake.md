## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Component Now Supports AWS S3 & GCS
Expand your Delta Lake operations with newly added support for reading and writing tables directly in AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

Our Delta Lake component has been updated to offer greater flexibility in managing your data lakes. You can now seamlessly read from and write to Delta Lake tables stored not only in previously supported locations but also directly within AWS S3 buckets and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets.

This enhancement allows you to integrate Keboola more closely with your existing cloud storage infrastructure. Simply provide the necessary credentials and configuration for your chosen cloud provider (AWS or GCP) to connect to your Delta tables.

Additionally, we've improved error handling: the component now provides a clear user error message if an unsupported storage provider is configured, preventing unexpected issues. We've also streamlined some internal configurations by removing specific low-level writer properties.



## Changes:



- added support for AWS + GCP 




- remove writer properties, raise user exception for unknown provider 




- flake8
