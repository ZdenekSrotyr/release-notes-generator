## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Component Enhanced: Now Supports AWS S3 & GCS Storage
Our Delta Lake component can now read from and write to Delta Lakes stored in AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage (GCS), alongside existing Azure support.

We've updated our Delta Lake component, significantly expanding its connectivity options and refining its configuration.

You can now seamlessly read from and write to Delta Lakes stored in AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage (GCS), alongside the existing Azure Blob Storage (ABS) support. Configure your preferred cloud storage provider and credentials, and the component takes care of the rest, giving you more flexibility in where you manage your Delta Lake data.

We've also streamlined the component's configuration by removing the `writer_properties` parameter. Furthermore, to improve usability, the component now provides clearer feedback by raising a specific error if an unsupported storage provider (other than ABS, AWS, or GCS) is selected, helping you correct configuration issues faster.



## Changes:



- added support for AWS + GCP 




- remove writer properties, raise user exception for unknown provider 




- flake8
