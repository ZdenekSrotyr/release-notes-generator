## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Component Adds AWS S3 & GCS Support
Read from and write to Delta Lake tables stored directly on AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

The Delta Lake component has been updated to support AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as storage backends, alongside the existing local storage option. This enhancement allows you to interact directly with Delta tables located in your cloud storage environments.

Configuration now includes a `storage_provider` parameter ('aws', 'gcp', or 'local') and corresponding credential fields. Based on these settings, the component establishes the correct connection to read from or write data to your specified Delta table location.

In this release, the `writer_properties` parameter has been removed. Consequently, passing specific configuration options directly to the underlying Parquet writer is no longer supported. The physical format of written Parquet files might differ if default writer properties vary from any previously used custom settings. Write operations are now explicitly set to `mode="append"`, ensuring data is consistently appended to the Delta table.

Internal improvements include refactored configuration handling and more specific error messages for invalid credentials or unsupported provider configurations, leading to clearer feedback for users.



## Changes:



- added support for AWS + GCP 




- remove writer properties, raise user exception for unknown provider 




- flake8
