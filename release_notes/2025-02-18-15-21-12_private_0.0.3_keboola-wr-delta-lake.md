## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Write Delta Tables to AWS S3 & GCP GCS

Excerpt: The Delta Lake Writer component now supports writing tables directly to AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

Post detail:
Expand your data destinations! The Delta Lake Writer component now enables writing Delta tables not only to Azure Blob Storage but also to AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage, alongside local path support.

Configure your preferred cloud storage using the new `provider` parameter ('aws', 'gcp', or 'azure') and provide the necessary credentials through newly added configuration fields. We've also included validation to ensure only supported providers are configured, preventing errors before processing starts.

Additionally, the option to pass custom `writer_properties` has been removed. The component now relies on the default writing behaviour and options provided by the underlying `deltalake` library for creating Delta tables.



## Changes:



- added support for AWS + GCP 




- remove writer properties, raise user exception for unknown provider 




- flake8
