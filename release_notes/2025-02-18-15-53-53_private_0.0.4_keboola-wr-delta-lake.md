## Change log (AI generated):
## Control Delta Storage & Updated Write Logic
Introducing Delta Lake compression options and removing the IGNORE write mode for component outputs.

We've updated component behavior to provide better control over storage and streamline write operations.

You can now configure data compression when writing Delta Lake tables. Choose between `SNAPPY` (the default), `GZIP`, `ZSTD`, or `NONE` to optimize storage usage based on your needs. This setting directly impacts the size of your resulting Delta tables.

Additionally, we have removed support for the `IGNORE` write mode. Components configured with this mode previously skipped writing data if the target table already existed. Now, writes will proceed using other available modes like `APPEND` or `OVERWRITE`, depending on your component's configuration. Please review your configurations if you were previously relying on the `IGNORE` behavior.

We've also added a specific internal exception for handling invalid write modes, improving error clarity behind the scenes without affecting standard data processing.
