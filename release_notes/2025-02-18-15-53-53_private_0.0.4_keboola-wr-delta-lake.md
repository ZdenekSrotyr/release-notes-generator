## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Delta Lake Writer Enhanced: Compression Added, 'Ignore' Mode Removed

Excerpt: The Delta Lake writer now automatically compresses data with Snappy and removes the 'ignore' write mode for clearer data handling.

Post Detail:
We've updated the Delta Lake writer component to improve storage efficiency and writing behavior. Data written to Delta Lake tables will now be compressed using the Snappy algorithm by default. This can help reduce the overall storage footprint of your tables. Note that data will be automatically decompressed during read operations.

Furthermore, we have removed the `ignore` option from the available write modes. This mode previously allowed write operations to be silently skipped if data already existed. To ensure more explicit control over data handling, you must now use one of the remaining write modes: `append`, `overwrite`, or `errorifexists`. This change clarifies how data conflicts are managed during the writing process.



## Changes:



- added compression, removed ignore mode
