## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Writer Update: Compression Support & Write Behavior Change
The Delta Lake Writer now supports data compression and features updated write mode behavior, removing the 'ignore' option.

We have enhanced the Delta Lake Writer component. You can now specify a compression type (such as snappy or gzip) when writing data to your Delta Lake tables. This allows for more efficient storage by reducing the physical size of the data on disk, which may also influence read and write performance.

Additionally, we have removed the 'ignore' write mode option. This change modifies how the component handles records during the writing process. Instead of potentially skipping conflicting rows as the 'ignore' mode did, the component will now rely on other available write modes (like append, overwrite, or error) to manage data ingestion, impacting how duplicates or conflicting entries are processed.



## Changes:



- added compression, removed ignore mode
