## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Component Gets Snappy Compression

Enhance Delta Lake storage efficiency with added Snappy compression and streamlined write modes.

This update to our Delta Lake component (version 0.0.4) introduces automatic Snappy compression for data written to your Delta tables. This optimization means your data will occupy less storage space, potentially leading to cost savings and improved read performance down the line, without changing the logical content of your data.

Additionally, we have streamlined the component's behaviour by removing support for the 'ignore' write mode. Configurations attempting to use this mode will now result in a validation error, providing clearer feedback and ensuring more predictable data handling compared to the previous potentially ambiguous behaviour of the 'ignore' setting.



## Changes:



- added compression, removed ignore mode
