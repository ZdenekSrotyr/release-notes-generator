Title: Compression Feature Added 

Excerpt: Data processing efficiency potentially improved with the addition of a compression feature.

Post detail: In this release, a compression feature has been added which may reduce the size of the data being processed, potentially improving processing speed and efficiency. Additionally, the 'ignore mode' has been removed, which could mean that the component now processes all data instead of ignoring certain data based on specific conditions.
