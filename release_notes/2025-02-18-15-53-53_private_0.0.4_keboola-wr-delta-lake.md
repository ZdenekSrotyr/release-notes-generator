## Change log (AI generated):
## Optimize Delta Writes: New Compression Options & Simplified Modes
Control Delta table storage size with new output compression settings and adapt to the removal of the 'IGNORE' write mode.

We've updated our Delta Writer component to give you more control over your output data and simplify write operations.

Introducing Output Compression: You can now specify the compression algorithm for the underlying Parquet files in your Delta tables using the new optional `compression` parameter. Choose from SNAPPY (default), GZIP, BROTLI, LZ4, ZSTD, or UNCOMPRESSED to optimize for storage space or I/O performance based on your needs. Invalid compression types will result in a user error, ensuring configuration correctness.

Simplifying Write Modes: We have removed the 'IGNORE' write mode option. This simplifies the component's behavior during data writes. Configurations previously using 'IGNORE' will now adhere strictly to the selected write mode (e.g., 'append' or 'overwrite'). Please review any configurations that used the 'IGNORE' mode, as their behavior might change, potentially leading to errors if constraints like duplicate keys are violated in 'append' mode.

These changes, along with improved internal error handling, aim to make Delta table writes more efficient and predictable.
