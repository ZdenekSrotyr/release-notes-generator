## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Writer Component Updated: Compression and Write Mode Changes
This update adds data compression options and removes the 'IGNORE' write mode for Delta table writing.

The component used for writing Delta tables has been updated. Key changes include added support for data compression and the removal of the 'IGNORE' write mode.

You can now specify a data compression algorithm (such as 'snappy', 'gzip', or 'zstd') via the component configuration using the new `compression` parameter. Data written to Delta tables will be compressed according to your selection. This impacts the physical storage size and potentially the read/write performance, but does not alter the logical data content.

Additionally, the 'IGNORE' write mode option has been removed from the component's configuration and functionality. The component will now always attempt to write data using one of the remaining modes: 'APPEND', 'OVERWRITE', or 'ERROR'. This change eliminates the previous possibility of silently skipping the write operation based on pre-existing data.

The component configuration interface has been updated accordingly to include the new `compression` setting and remove 'IGNORE' from the available write actions.
