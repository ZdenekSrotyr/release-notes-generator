## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Component Update: Compression & Stricter Writes
Our Delta Lake component now supports output compression and has removed the 'ignore' write mode for more predictable behavior.

We've updated our Delta Lake component with new configuration options and refined behavior for writing data.

You can now optimize your Delta Lake storage by specifying a compression codec. A new `compression` parameter allows you to choose options like `snappy` or `gzip` when writing Delta tables. This can significantly reduce storage footprint and may improve read/write performance depending on your data and workload.

Additionally, we have removed the `ignore` write mode option. This change ensures more predictable behavior when writing data. If the target location already contains data and the write mode is set to prevent overwriting (like the default `errorifexists`), the component will now correctly raise an error instead of silently skipping the write operation. This helps prevent unintended data inconsistencies and aligns with standard Delta Lake write behaviors.
