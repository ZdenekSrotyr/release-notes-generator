## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Writer Enhancements: Compression & Write Mode Updates
Updates to the Delta Lake writer include configurable compression options and stricter validation for write modes.

The Delta Lake writer component has been updated with two key changes affecting configuration and behavior.

First, you can now configure the compression used for output Delta Lake files. A new `compression` parameter allows specifying `snappy`, `gzip`, `zstd`, or `uncompressed`. If this parameter is not set, the component will not specify a compression option, allowing Spark and Delta Lake to use their default settings. This change impacts the physical size of the stored Delta table files, while the logical data remains unchanged.

Second, the handling of the `write_mode` parameter has been updated. The previously implicit "ignore" mode is no longer supported. The component now strictly validates the `write_mode`, accepting only `append`, `overwrite`, or `errorifexists`. The default value remains `append`. This change ensures more predictable behavior during write operations, as the action taken (appending, overwriting, or raising an error) must be explicitly chosen from the allowed options.



## Changes:



- added compression, removed ignore mode
