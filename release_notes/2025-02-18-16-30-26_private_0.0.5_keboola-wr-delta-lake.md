## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Writer: More Efficient & Reliable
Our Delta Lake writer component (v0.0.5) now compresses data for better storage efficiency and handles existing data more predictably by removing the 'ignore' write mode.

We've updated our Delta Lake writer component to enhance performance and ensure greater data integrity during write operations.

Firstly, we've introduced data compression (using standard methods like snappy) for all data written to Delta tables. This change significantly reduces the physical storage space required for your Delta Lake files, leading to cost savings and potentially faster read/write operations depending on your workload. The logical data content remains unchanged.

Secondly, the writer will no longer use the `ignore` mode when saving data. Previously, this mode would silently skip writing data if records for a given partition or matching merge keys already existed. By removing this mode, we ensure more predictable behavior. Now, how existing data is handled (e.g., appending, overwriting, or raising an error) depends explicitly on the configuration, preventing accidental data omission and promoting clearer data handling strategies.



## Changes:



- added compression, removed ignore mode
