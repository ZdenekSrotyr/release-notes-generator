## Change log (AI generated):
## Delta Lake Writer: Compression Control & Write Mode Update
Fine-tune Delta table storage with compression options and note an important change to write behavior.

Our Delta Lake Writer component has been updated. You can now specify the compression algorithm used for the underlying Parquet files within your Delta tables. Use the optional `compression` parameter to choose between `snappy` (the default), `gzip`, or `zstd` to optimize for storage space or read/write performance based on your needs.

Additionally, the `IGNORE` write mode option has been removed. Previously, configuring the writer with `IGNORE` would cause it to skip the write operation if the target Delta table already existed. Now, the writer will always proceed based on the selected `APPEND` or `OVERWRITE` mode, potentially modifying or replacing data in existing tables. Please review your configurations that may have previously relied on the `IGNORE` behavior.



## Changes:



- added compression, removed ignore mode
