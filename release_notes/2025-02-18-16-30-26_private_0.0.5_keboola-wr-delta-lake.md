## Change log (AI generated):
## Fine-Tune Your Delta Lake Writes: Compression & Mode Update
Control storage and ensure writes with the updated Delta Lake writer, featuring compression and removal of the 'ignore' mode.

We've updated the Delta Lake writer component to give you more control and ensure more predictable write operations.

First, we've removed the 'ignore' write mode. Previously, selecting this mode would cause the component to skip the write operation entirely if the target Delta table already existed. Now, the component will always attempt to write data based on the specified mode (like 'overwrite' or 'append'), ensuring your data loading jobs proceed as intended without silent skips. Please review any configurations using the 'ignore' mode, as they will now result in data being written to existing tables.

Second, you can now specify a compression algorithm when writing Delta Lake tables. By configuring the desired compression (e.g., 'snappy', 'gzip') in the component settings, the underlying Parquet files within your Delta table will be compressed accordingly. This allows you to optimize for storage space and potentially influence read/write performance based on your specific needs.
