## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Delta Writer: Compression Added, Ignore Mode Removed

**Excerpt:** Enhance Delta table storage efficiency with new compression options and note the removal of the 'ignore' write mode.

**Post Detail:**
We've updated the Delta Writer component, introducing data compression capabilities for your output Delta tables. You can now configure the desired compression codec (`snappy`, `gzip`, `zstd`, or `none`) directly in the component settings. Applying compression alters the physical storage format of the table files and can help reduce overall storage size, unless 'none' is selected.

In this update, we have also removed the `WriteMode.IGNORE` option. This write mode, which previously allowed skipping the writing of incoming data rows if matching data already existed in the target table, is no longer supported. Any component configuration attempting to use the "ignore" write mode will now fail validation.



## Changes:



- added compression, removed ignore mode
