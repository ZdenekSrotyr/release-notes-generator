## Change log (AI generated):
## Streamlined Agreement Data: Custom Fields Now Columns
We've updated the 'agreement' endpoint to flatten nested custom field data into easily accessible columns.

We're enhancing how data from the 'agreement' endpoint is processed to simplify your workflows. Previously, custom field information was nested within a `customField` list, requiring extra steps to extract and utilize this data effectively.

With this update, data retrieved from the 'agreement' endpoint now undergoes an automatic flattening process. Each custom field, originally structured as `{'customFieldId': 'ID', 'value': 'VALUE'}`, is transformed into a separate top-level column named `customField_ID` containing its corresponding `VALUE`. The original nested `customField` list is removed.

This change makes custom field data directly accessible as distinct columns in your output tables, significantly simplifying data preparation and analysis, especially in tabular environments. Please note that this structural change applies only to data retrieved from the 'agreement' endpoint; data from other endpoints remains unaffected.
