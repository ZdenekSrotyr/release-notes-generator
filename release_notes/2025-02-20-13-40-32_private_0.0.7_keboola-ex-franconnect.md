## Change log (AI generated):
## Streamlined Agreement Data: Now Flattened
Data retrieved from the 'agreement' endpoint is now automatically flattened into a more granular, analysis-ready format.

We have introduced a specific data processing enhancement for the 'agreement' endpoint. Previously, data retrieved from this endpoint maintained its original, potentially nested structure.

With this update, the 'agreement' data undergoes a flattening transformation. Each row in the resulting output now represents a single field within a section of an agreement. Key contextual information, including `agreementId`, `lastUpdatedDate`, `sectionName`, and `sectionSequence`, is incorporated into every row, simplifying data analysis and integration.

This change applies exclusively to the 'agreement' endpoint; data processing for all other endpoints remains unaffected.
