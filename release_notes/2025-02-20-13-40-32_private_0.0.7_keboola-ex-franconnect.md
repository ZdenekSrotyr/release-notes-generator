## Change log (AI generated):
## Streamlined Franconnect Agreement Data Structure
The Franconnect extractor now automatically flattens nested `agreement` data into distinct columns for easier use.

We've updated the Franconnect extractor to improve how data from the `agreement` endpoint is handled. Previously, nested information within the agreement data might have required additional parsing steps.

This update introduces data flattening for the `agreement` endpoint response. Nested structures are now automatically unpacked and presented as standard top-level columns in your output table. This means fields previously contained within complex structures will appear as separate columns, potentially using concatenated names to indicate their original hierarchy (e.g., `parent_child`).

This change simplifies the output structure, making the agreement data more accessible and easier to query directly without needing to handle nested JSON or complex types. Please review your downstream workflows that utilize the Franconnect `agreement` data to ensure compatibility with the new flattened format.
