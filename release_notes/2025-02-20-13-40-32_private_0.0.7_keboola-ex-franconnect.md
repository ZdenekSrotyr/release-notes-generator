## Change log (AI generated):
## Easier Analysis: Flattened Agreements Data
Nested data within the 'agreements' endpoint response is now automatically flattened into top-level columns for simpler use.

We've updated how data from the 'agreements' endpoint is processed to simplify its structure and make it easier to work with in your tables.

Previously, nested JSON structures within agreement records might require complex handling or be stored in less accessible formats. Now, these nested structures are automatically flattened before being written to the output table. Each nested field is transformed into a distinct top-level column.

The new column names are generated by combining the parent and child keys using an underscore (`_`) as a separator. For instance, a nested `child` object under a `parent` object would result in columns like `parent_child_field1`, `parent_child_field2`, etc. This enhancement streamlines data analysis and integration by providing a readily usable tabular format directly from the endpoint.
