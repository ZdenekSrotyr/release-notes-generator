## Change log (AI generated):
## Agreement Endpoint Output Update: Data Flattening
Data retrieved from the 'agreement' endpoint is now automatically flattened, simplifying its structure.

We have updated the data processing logic specifically for responses received from the 'agreement' endpoint. Data retrieved from this endpoint will now undergo an automatic flattening process before being outputted.

This change transforms previously nested data structures within the 'agreement' response into a flat format. Consequently, the output table schema for the 'agreement' endpoint data may now feature a different structure, potentially including more columns, to represent the flattened data effectively.



## Changes:



- flatten agreement endpoint data
