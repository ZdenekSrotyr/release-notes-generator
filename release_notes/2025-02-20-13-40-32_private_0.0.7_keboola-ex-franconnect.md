## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Agreement Endpoint Data Now Flattened

**Excerpt:** Data retrieved from the 'agreement' endpoint is now automatically flattened for easier use.

**Post Detail:**
We have updated the data processing logic for records retrieved specifically from the 'agreement' endpoint. Previously, these records were stored preserving their original nested structure as received from the source.

Effective immediately, data flattening is automatically applied to each record from the 'agreement' endpoint before it is saved to your output tables. This change modifies the output table structure for this endpoint. Nested objects will now be represented as separate columns, with column names indicating the original hierarchy (e.g., `parent_child`), resulting in a flatter table format.
