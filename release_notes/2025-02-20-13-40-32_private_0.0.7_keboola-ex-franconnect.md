## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Data Flattening of Agreement Endpoint

Excerpt: Changes in data structure from nested to flat may impact downstream data processing tasks.

Post detail: The data from the agreement endpoint is now being flattened, altering the structure of the output data. Previously, the data output was nested, but with this update, it will be presented in a flat structure. This change could potentially impact downstream data processing tasks that are designed to handle data in the old, nested structure. No other changes affecting data processing, output, error handling, configuration options, or component behavior were reported in this update. Specific file and location of the change were not provided.
