**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.14](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.14)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Upsert Logic Simplified
Updates to our Pinecone integration simplify how vectors are written, streamlining the upsert process.

We have modified the method for upserting data into Pinecone vector databases within our platform components. The logic previously involved a potential check for existing vector IDs before writing new data.

This pre-check step has been removed. All vectors provided within a batch are now directly upserted into Pinecone without a preliminary fetch attempt based on IDs. This change streamlines the data loading interaction with the Pinecone service, simplifying the overall data writing flow.
