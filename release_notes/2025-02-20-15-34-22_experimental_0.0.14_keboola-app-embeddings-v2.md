## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Writer: Optimized Upsert Logic
Updated Pinecone writer streamlines data handling during upserts.

We've refined the way our Pinecone vector database integration handles data loading. Specifically, we've optimized the `load_data_batch` process.

Previously, the writer would first attempt to fetch existing records by their IDs from Pinecone before proceeding with the upsert operation. We have removed this preliminary fetch step. The writer now directly calls Pinecone's `upsert` function for each data batch.

This change modifies how potential updates or conflicts are handled. Instead of pre-checking, the writer now relies on Pinecone's native upsert behavior and robust error handling. Records that cause an issue during the upsert process (resulting in specific API errors like code 400) will be skipped, ensuring the rest of the batch can be processed. This streamlines the interaction with the Pinecone API for potentially more efficient data loading.
