## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Pinecone Connector: Vector Fetching by ID Removed

**Excerpt:** The Pinecone connector no longer supports fetching vectors by their specific IDs due to changes in the underlying method.

**Post detail:**
We have updated the Pinecone connector. The primary change involves the removal of the functionality to fetch vectors by their specific IDs. The `fetch_vectors` method within the connector will now raise a `NotImplementedError` instead of retrieving data from Pinecone based on vector IDs. Consequently, direct vector retrieval using specific IDs through this connector is no longer possible.

Additionally, the "test connection" action for Pinecone has been modified. It no longer attempts to embed a test string. Instead, it now tries to fetch a vector using a predefined, non-existent ID (`_keboola_test_connection_id`). This change alters how connectivity and index access are verified during the test connection process but does not affect the core functionality of embedding or upserting data.
