**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.14](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.14)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Integration: Updated Vector ID Retrieval
Our Pinecone integration now uses a different method to identify existing vector IDs before upserting data.

We have modified the way our Pinecone integration checks for existing vector IDs before performing an upsert operation.

The component now retrieves a list of vector IDs within the index (optionally filtered by a prefix) using Pinecone's `list` operation, instead of fetching specific IDs individually using `fetch`. The relevant existing IDs are then identified from this retrieved list.

This adjustment alters the logic for identifying pre-existing data in your Pinecone index. Consequently, it may affect which records are identified as new versus existing, potentially changing the set of vectors added or updated during a component run.
