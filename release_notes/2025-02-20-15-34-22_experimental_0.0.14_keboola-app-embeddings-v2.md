**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Vector Deletion Method Updated
Pinecone vector deletion logic updated to ensure reliable data removal.

We've updated the method used for deleting vectors within Pinecone vector stores integrated with Keboola.

The system now deletes vectors individually by their ID, replacing the previous batch deletion approach. This change ensures more reliable and consistent vector removal, addressing potential limitations encountered with the batch operation in the Pinecone client.

This is an internal adjustment focused on operational stability. The logic determining *which* vectors are selected for deletion has not changed, ensuring your data management rules remain effective.
