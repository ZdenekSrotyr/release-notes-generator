## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Integration Enhancements for Reliability
We've updated our Pinecone integration for more reliable data upserts and connection testing.

We have rolled out updates to enhance the reliability of our Pinecone integration. These changes focus on improving the data upsert process and connection validation.

To ensure greater correctness when updating data, we've modified how existing vector IDs are checked in Pinecone before an upsert. Instead of fetching many IDs at once, the process now retrieves them individually within batches. This adjustment aligns more closely with Pinecone's expected API behaviour, potentially impacting performance on very large datasets but significantly boosting the reliability of data updates.

Additionally, we've refined the logic behind the "Test Connection" feature for Pinecone. This ensures a more accurate and robust validation of your credentials and index accessibility when setting up or checking your Pinecone connection.
