_Released on 2025-02-20_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.14](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.14)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Reliability for Pinecone Vector Operations
Updates to our Pinecone integration enhance the reliability of vector deletion and upsert processes.

We've rolled out updates to our Pinecone vector store integration, improving how it handles vector deletion and upsert operations for better reliability and performance.

The logic for deleting vectors has been refined. Instead of attempting large bulk deletions at once, the component now processes vector IDs in smaller, manageable chunks. This change addresses potential Pinecone API limitations and ensures smoother, more dependable removal of vectors, especially when working with large datasets.

We have also improved the process for identifying existing vectors before an upsert. The component now uses a more robust, chunk-based approach to fetch existing vector IDs from Pinecone. This ensures accurate detection of vectors needing an update versus new vectors requiring insertion, contributing to greater data consistency within your index.

These enhancements provide more resilient and stable vector management when using the Pinecone integration in your Keboola projects.
