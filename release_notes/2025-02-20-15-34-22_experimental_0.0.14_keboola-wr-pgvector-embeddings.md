# Title
Pinecone Connector Reliability Enhancements

# Excerpt
Updates to the Pinecone Connector improve vector retrieval logic and streamline connection testing.

# Post Detail
We have updated the Pinecone Connector with improvements to enhance reliability and usability.

The method for retrieving existing vectors from Pinecone by their source primary key has been revised. Instead of using Pinecone's batch `fetch` operation, the connector now iterates through requested IDs and performs individual `query` operations using a metadata filter based on your source table's primary key. This change affects the logic for checking existing vectors before upserting and ensures functionality even if batch fetching by ID faces issues.

Additionally, the connection testing mechanism has been modified. The 'Test Connection' action now attempts to describe a specific, non-existent index rather than listing all available indexes. This verifies credentials and connectivity effectively without requiring index listing permissions or depending on the presence of existing indexes in your Pinecone environment. This change only impacts the 'Test Connection' functionality and does not affect regular data processing runs.
