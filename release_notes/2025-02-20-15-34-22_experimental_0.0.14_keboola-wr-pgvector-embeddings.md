**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.14](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.14)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Refined Pinecone Vector Retrieval
We've updated the process for retrieving existing vectors by ID from the Pinecone vector database to enhance reliability.

We have modified the internal mechanism used to fetch vectors from Pinecone when specific vector IDs are known. Previously, multiple vector IDs were requested from Pinecone in a single batch operation.

The retrieval logic now fetches data for each vector ID individually through separate API calls. While this approach might slightly increase the total time required to fetch a large number of vectors due to multiple requests, it improves the robustness of the operation, potentially preventing errors associated with large batch requests and ensuring more consistent vector retrieval. The content of the retrieved data remains the same.
