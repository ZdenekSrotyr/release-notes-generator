## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Pinecone Namespace Support Added

Excerpt: Organize and manage your Pinecone vector data more effectively using namespaces for upsert and delete operations.

Post Detail:
We've enhanced our Pinecone integration by adding explicit support for namespaces.

You can now specify a target namespace when performing upsert and delete operations. This ensures your data is correctly routed within your Pinecone index, allowing for precise data insertion and removal within designated areas. This change improves data isolation and provides finer control over the scope of your vector data management.
