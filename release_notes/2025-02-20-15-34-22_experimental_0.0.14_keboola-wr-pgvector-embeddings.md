## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Loader: Improved Vector Deletion Reliability
The Pinecone loader now more reliably deletes vectors by verifying their existence before removal.

We've enhanced the vector deletion process within our Pinecone vector database loader component for increased robustness.

The updated process now explicitly fetches and verifies the existence of vectors using their IDs *before* initiating the deletion command in Pinecone. This replaces a potentially less reliable method for identifying vectors prior to deletion.

This change significantly improves the reliability of removing specific vectors from your Pinecone index. It ensures the component only attempts to delete vectors confirmed to exist, preventing potential errors related to non-existent IDs and ensuring smoother data cleanup operations. The set of data intended for deletion remains the same, but the mechanism is now more robust.
