**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.14](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.14)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Vector DB Writer: Pinecone Upsert Handling Updated
The Vector Database Writer component adjusts how it handles potential data conflicts during upserts for Pinecone destinations.

We have updated the Vector Database Writer component's behavior when upserting data into Pinecone.

Previously, when potential ID conflicts occurred during an upsert, the component attempted to fetch existing vectors by their IDs for comparison before proceeding. This pre-fetch step has been removed specifically for Pinecone destinations because the underlying Pinecone API method did not support fetching by ID as required by the component's logic.

This change impacts the conflict resolution logic during data synchronization solely for Pinecone. The component no longer performs the pre-upsert validation check based on fetching existing vector data by ID.

Additionally, the internal implementation of the `testConnection` action has been refactored to use static methods. This internal change does not affect the primary functionality of embedding and upserting data during the `run` action.
