**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Pinecone Data Upsertion
This update improves how we check for existing IDs in Pinecone, ensuring accurate data synchronization.

We have released an update to our Pinecone integration, specifically improving the mechanism used to check for existing vector IDs before data is loaded. This change addresses potential issues with previous methods, refining how the component identifies records already present in your Pinecone index.

This enhancement ensures greater reliability during the data upsertion process. By more accurately determining if a record ID already exists, the integration can correctly decide whether to update the existing record or skip it, preventing potential data inconsistencies and ensuring your Pinecone index accurately reflects your source data. This leads to more robust and trustworthy data synchronization workflows involving Pinecone.
