**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.14](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.14)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Interaction Update
Updated Pinecone vector ID fetching for compatibility and refined the connection test logic.

We have modified how the component interacts with Pinecone when checking for existing data. Previously, vector IDs were fetched in batches. This has been changed to fetch vector IDs individually. This adjustment ensures compatibility or works around an existing issue related to batch fetching, although it may have performance implications compared to the previous batch method. The core logic of checking for existing IDs remains the same.

Additionally, the logic used by the 'Test Connection' feature has been updated. This change only affects the verification process performed when you explicitly test the connection settings and does not impact the component's main data processing during a standard run.



## Changes:



- Change test connection method 




- Fix WF 




- Update Version 






- Fix all wfs and update versions 




- PR #14
