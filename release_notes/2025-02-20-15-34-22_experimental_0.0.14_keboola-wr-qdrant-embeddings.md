## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Vector Fetching Update for Reliability
We've updated the Pinecone component's vector fetching method for improved reliability when checking existing data.

We have improved the way our Pinecone vector store component identifies existing vectors within your index.

The component previously attempted to retrieve multiple vectors simultaneously by their IDs using a single API call. To enhance reliability and ensure better compatibility with Pinecone's API capabilities, we've adjusted this process. The component now fetches each required vector individually in sequence using separate API calls.

This update ensures a more stable and dependable check for existing records before performing upsert operations, preventing potential issues related to bulk fetching limitations or specific API behaviors. While fetching vectors one by one may introduce minor performance considerations compared to a bulk approach, this change prioritizes the accuracy and reliability of your data synchronization with Pinecone.
