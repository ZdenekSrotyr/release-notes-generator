## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Integration: Improved Vector Upsert Handling
We've refined our Pinecone integration to ensure more reliable handling of existing vectors during data upserts.

We have updated the way our platform interacts with Pinecone when checking for existing vector IDs prior to upserting new data.

This refinement was made to align with recent Pinecone API behavior regarding the retrieval of vectors by their IDs, ensuring continued compatibility.

The update improves the reliability of data upsert operations into Pinecone, particularly when managing datasets that include vectors already present in your index. This adjustment focuses on the backend interaction to maintain smooth and stable data synchronization with your Pinecone vector store.
