**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Reliability for Pinecone Vector Upserts
Improved handling of existing vector IDs in Pinecone ensures more reliable data upsert operations.

We have updated our Pinecone vector store integration to improve the way existing vector IDs are identified before adding new data.

Previously, the system attempted to retrieve multiple existing vector IDs from Pinecone in a single request. This approach occasionally led to errors due to how Pinecone processes bulk ID fetches.

To address this, the integration now fetches vector IDs individually within a loop when checking for existing entries. This change corrects the logic for identifying pre-existing vectors, ensuring that the upsert process handles existing IDs reliably and prevents the errors encountered with the previous method. This update specifically modifies the `add_texts` method within the `PineconeVectorStore`.
