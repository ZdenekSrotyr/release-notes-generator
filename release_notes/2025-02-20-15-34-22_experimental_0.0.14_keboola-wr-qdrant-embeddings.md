## Change log (AI generated):
Pinecone Embeddings V2 Connector Performance Enhancements
The Pinecone Embeddings V2 connector now leverages native Pinecone operations for faster, more direct upserts and deletes.

We've enhanced the Pinecone Embeddings V2 connector for more efficient data handling. The component previously performed individual checks for record ID existence using `index.fetch` before upserting or deleting data. This pre-check step, which verified IDs individually, has been streamlined.

The connector now directly leverages Pinecone's robust native `upsert` and `delete` operations. Instead of verifying each ID beforehand within the component, it sends batches for upsert directly, letting Pinecone handle the creation or update logic internally based on ID presence. Deletions are also now attempted directly for the specified IDs without a component-level pre-check. This change simplifies the interaction and relies on Pinecone's optimized backend processing, leading to more straightforward data synchronization.

Other updates include a refined "Test Connection" process which now uses index statistics (`describe_index_stats`) for verification instead of fetching a test ID, and an update to the underlying `pinecone-client` library version.
