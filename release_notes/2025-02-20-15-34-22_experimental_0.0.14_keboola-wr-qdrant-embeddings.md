_Released on 2025-02-20_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.14](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.14)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Faster, More Resilient Pinecone Vector Upserts
We've streamlined the process for adding text embeddings to Pinecone, enhancing performance and error resilience.

We've fine-tuned the way Keboola interacts with Pinecone when adding text embeddings, focusing on speed and robustness.

Previously, we performed a check (`fetch`) to see if vector IDs already existed before adding them (`upsert`). We've removed this pre-fetch step to potentially speed up the upsert process, especially for large datasets. Now, we attempt the upsert directly and have implemented more specific error handling.

If the Pinecone API returns a specific error (`ApiException` status 400) during an upsert, instead of potentially halting the process, we now log a warning and skip only the problematic vector. This makes the integration more resilient to certain isolated issues returned by the Pinecone API, allowing the rest of your data to be processed smoothly.

Keep in mind that vectors skipped due to this specific error won't be added to Pinecone. While this enhances overall stability against these specific errors, check your job logs for warnings if you encounter unexpected gaps in your vector data.
