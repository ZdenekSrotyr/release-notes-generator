## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Improved Pinecone Vector Retrieval

Excerpt: Vector retrieval from Pinecone now fetches vectors individually for improved handling.

Post detail:
We have modified the method for retrieving existing vectors from Pinecone vector stores. Previously, vectors were fetched in batches based on their IDs. The process now involves fetching each vector individually using separate requests within a loop.

This adjustment alters the underlying process of interacting with Pinecone when checking for existing vectors. While the same vector data is ultimately retrieved, this updated approach aims to enhance reliability by addressing potential issues or limitations sometimes encountered with Pinecone's batch fetching capabilities based on specific vector IDs. This change primarily affects the retrieval process and may influence performance due to the shift from single batch requests to multiple individual requests.
