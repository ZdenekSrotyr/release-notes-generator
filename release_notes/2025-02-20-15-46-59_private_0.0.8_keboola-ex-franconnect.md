## Change log (AI generated):
## Termination Endpoint Data Structure Updated: Nested Data Flattened
Data retrieved from the 'termination' API endpoint will now have nested structures automatically flattened into columns.

We've updated the processing logic for data coming from the 'termination' API endpoint. Previously, nested data structures like JSON objects or arrays within fields were kept in their original nested format in the output.

This update introduces automatic flattening for these nested structures. Nested fields will now be converted into distinct columns within the output table. The naming convention for these new columns will reflect the original hierarchy, such as `parent_child` for a `child` field nested within a `parent` object.

If your processes rely on data from the 'termination' endpoint and expect the previous nested format, please review and potentially adjust your workflows to align with this new flattened structure. This change provides a more direct tabular representation of the data.
