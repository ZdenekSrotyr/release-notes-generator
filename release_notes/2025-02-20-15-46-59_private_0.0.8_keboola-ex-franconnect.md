## Change log (AI generated):
## Termination Endpoint Data Now Flattened
The response data from the 'termination' endpoint is now delivered in a flat structure.

We have implemented data flattening for the response retrieved from the 'termination' endpoint.

This means any potentially nested data structures within the endpoint's response are now automatically processed and transformed into a flat format before being outputted. This change directly impacts the structure of the resulting table for this specific endpoint, likely resulting in additional columns corresponding to the previously nested fields.



## Changes:



- flatten termination endpoint data
