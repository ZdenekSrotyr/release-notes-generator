## Change log (AI generated):
## Franconnect Extractor Update: Termination Data Flattening
Franconnect extractor now simplifies 'termination' endpoint data by flattening nested structures.

We have updated the Franconnect extractor to improve the handling of data retrieved from the 'termination' endpoint.

Previously, records from this endpoint could contain nested structures. With this update, these nested structures are now automatically flattened into a simple key-value format before being written to your output tables. This change results in a different, flatter structure for data originating specifically from the 'termination' endpoint in the output CSV files. Data retrieved from other Franconnect endpoints remains unchanged by this modification.

This flattening simplifies the data structure, making it easier to analyze and integrate with other tools in your workflows.
