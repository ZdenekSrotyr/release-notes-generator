## Change log (AI generated):
## Easier Analysis: Termination API Now Returns Flat Data
Termination API responses are now automatically flattened, simplifying data loading and analysis.

We've enhanced the termination API endpoint to automatically flatten its data response. Previously, responses could contain nested structures (like JSON objects within objects or arrays). Now, this complex data is transformed into a simple, flat tabular structure before being delivered.

This change means nested fields are converted into distinct columns, often combining parent and child keys (e.g., `parent_child`). The primary benefit is easier data handling and analysis, as the flattened data is ready for direct loading into tables or BI tools without requiring additional parsing steps. Please note that the output schema for data retrieved via this endpoint will reflect this new flattened structure.



## Changes:
