## Change log (AI generated):
Franconnect Termination Data Flattened
Nested data in the Franconnect FranchiseeTerminationDetails endpoint is now automatically flattened into top-level columns for easier access.

We have implemented data flattening for the `/V2/FranchiseeTerminationDetails` endpoint within the Franconnect component. Previously, nested data structures within this endpoint, such as `TerminationDetails`, might have been output as complex types like JSON strings.

With this update, fields within these nested structures are now extracted and promoted to top-level columns in the output table. This changes the structure of the output data for the `FranchiseeTerminationDetails` endpoint, making previously nested fields directly accessible as individual columns.
