## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Run Any Airbyte Source Connector

**Excerpt:** Run any compatible Airbyte source connector image to extract data directly into Keboola Storage.

**Post detail:**
The Generic Extractor component has been fundamentally updated to leverage Airbyte source connectors. It now utilizes the `pyairbyte` library to manage the full lifecycle (`check`, `discover`, `read`) of a specified Airbyte source connector Docker image, replacing the previous data extraction mechanism.

This update introduces robust state management. The component reads the last known state, passes it to the connector for incremental processing, captures the latest state emitted during the run, and saves it for the next execution. This enables efficient incremental data loading for sources that support it.

Users can now precisely control which data is fetched using the `selected_streams` configuration parameter. Only streams explicitly chosen will be requested from the Airbyte source and processed. Data is written to CSV files, one per selected stream, in the `/data/out/tables/` directory. Manifest files detailing table structure, including primary keys defined in the Airbyte catalog, are automatically generated. Configuration handling is enhanced with validation to ensure required parameters like the connector image, credentials, and stream selections are correctly provided.

A basic framework for running "sync actions" after the main data extraction has also been added, allowing for potential post-processing steps based on the extracted data tables. Telemetry reporting from the underlying `pyairbyte` library has been disabled.
