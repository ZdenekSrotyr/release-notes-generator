## Change log (AI generated):
## Updated Airbyte Connectors: Now with Incremental Loading Support
Enable incremental loading and ensure accurate table definitions with the latest updates to our Airbyte-based connectors.

We've enhanced our Airbyte-based components to significantly improve data extraction workflows. The key update is the implementation of state persistence: the component now correctly saves the final Airbyte STATE message upon successful completion. This enables true incremental loading, allowing subsequent runs to pick up only new or updated data from the source system, leading to faster and more efficient syncs.

Additionally, this update addresses issues with manifest file generation. Table structures, including primary keys and other metadata, are now correctly defined in the `.csv.manifest` files, ensuring seamless and accurate loading into Keboola Storage.

Other improvements include refined internal state management during the synchronization process, enhanced configuration validation for a smoother setup, more informative logging for easier monitoring, and the disabling of telemetry data collection by the underlying Airbyte library. These changes contribute to a more robust, reliable, and efficient data extraction experience.
