## Change log (AI generated):
## Airbyte Integration Enhanced with Incremental Loading and Primary Keys

Our Airbyte integration components now support incremental data loading via state management and automatically define primary keys for output tables in Keboola Storage.

We've upgraded our Airbyte integration capabilities, introducing two significant improvements to enhance data handling and efficiency.

First, state management has been implemented. Components now read the input state before an Airbyte sync and save the output state upon successful completion. This enables incremental data loading, meaning subsequent runs will only process new or updated data based on the state from the previous run, making your syncs faster and more efficient.

Second, the integration now automatically creates Keboola manifest files for each output table. These manifests include primary key definitions derived directly from the Airbyte stream configuration. This ensures your table structure, specifically primary keys, is correctly defined in Keboola Storage upon import, improving data integrity and downstream processing.

Additionally, configuration validation has been added to ensure essential parameters are present before the component runs, improving reliability by catching setup errors early. Airbyte telemetry has also been disabled within the component's runtime environment.
