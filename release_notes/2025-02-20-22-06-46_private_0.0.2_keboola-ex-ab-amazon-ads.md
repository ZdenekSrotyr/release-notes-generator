## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Reliability for Airbyte Connectors
Key fixes to state management and manifest generation ensure more robust and accurate data synchronization via Airbyte.

We've released an update to our Airbyte connector component focusing on improved reliability and data accuracy, particularly for incremental data loads.

This update addresses two core areas:
1.  **State Management:** We've implemented crucial fixes to how the connector handles state persistence. This ensures that incremental runs correctly identify and process only new or updated data from the source since the last sync. Accurate state management is vital for preventing duplicate data extraction and maintaining data consistency over time.
2.  **Output Manifests:** Changes were made to correct the generation of output table manifest files. This guarantees that the metadata describing your output tables (including column names, data types, and primary keys) is accurate, preventing potential errors during loading into Keboola Storage and ensuring correct table structures.

Additionally, this update includes improved configuration validation for increased robustness against invalid settings and adds more detailed logging for better observability during component runs. These changes contribute to more stable and predictable data synchronization using Airbyte sources.
