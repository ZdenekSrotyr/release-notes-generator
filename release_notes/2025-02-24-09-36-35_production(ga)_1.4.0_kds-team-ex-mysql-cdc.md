**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Component Enhanced: Improved Data Handling & Stability

Our CDC component now automatically flags deleted records and ignores Debezium heartbeats for cleaner data output, alongside performance and stability enhancements.

We've released updates to our Change Data Capture (CDC) component focusing on data quality, processing consistency, and overall stability. These improvements refine how CDC data is processed and delivered to your output tables.

Key changes include:

*   **Automatic Deleted Flag:** The `_kbc_deleted` flag is now derived automatically based on the Debezium operation type (`op` field). This ensures delete operations are accurately reflected in your data without requiring explicit configuration.
*   **Heartbeat Event Filtering:** Debezium heartbeat events are now explicitly ignored during processing. These technical events will no longer appear in your output tables, resulting in cleaner and more focused datasets.
*   **Consistent Deduplication Chunking:** The deduplication process now always uses size-based chunking. This standardizes the internal mechanics of how data is processed for deduplication, particularly for large datasets.

Additionally, internal configurations related to DuckDB memory management have been refined, and significant code refactoring has been performed. These behind-the-scenes changes aim to improve the component's overall performance, stability, and maintainability.
