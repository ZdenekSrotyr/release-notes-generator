## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Component Update: Memory Optimization and Data Handling Improvements
This update optimizes DuckDB memory configuration, excludes Debezium heartbeat events from output, and refines internal CDC data processing mechanisms.

The CDC component has been updated with several changes affecting data processing and performance.

DuckDB memory management has been refined. The `memory_limit` configuration option, an alias for `max_memory`, was removed. The handling of the `max_memory` setting was updated, potentially adjusting available memory for DuckDB operations like deduplication and writing, which can impact performance and the ability to process larger datasets.

Debezium heartbeat events are now explicitly identified and skipped during processing. Consequently, these events will no longer appear in the output data tables.

The deduplication process has been modified to consistently use size-based chunking for preparing data batches. While this changes the internal mechanism for splitting data before deduplication, the final deduplicated data remains logically consistent.

Input data processing is affected by an upstream change: the `__deleted` field is now automatically derived based on the Debezium operation type (e.g., 'd' for delete), simplifying the data structure consumed by the component.

Additionally, extensive internal code refactoring was performed across various modules to improve code organization and maintainability, without altering the core data processing logic.



## Changes:

- Unified and optimized docker images 




- Using Java 21 and unifiying build and runtime distribution 




- Removing duplicit logstash-gelf dependency 




- Removed build-essential from docker image as it is not required 




- Cleaned up notification implementation 




- Initial refactoring of configuration classes 




- Fixed name typo: Dedube -> Dedupe 




- Refactored CDC target and DuckDB configuration 




- Renamed DuckDbWrapper to DuckDbClient 




- Using more descriptive field and method names in state object 




- Simplified and better structured SyncStats methods 




- First cleanup of task shutdown and completion 




- Renamed (duckdb) converters to writers 




- Cleaning up writer implementation 




- Minor config and SnapshotProcessConsumer tweakes 




- Refactoring main processing logic (pt1) 




- Refactoring main processing logic (pt2) 




- Refactoring schema/result loading and saving 




- Added Consumer docs and cleaned up unused attributes 




- Renamed AbstractDebeziumTask as it is not abstract 




- Renamed SnapshotProcessConsumer to more descriptive SnapshotResult 




- Isolated json serialisation (GSON) into single class 




- Removed unwrap transformation from README as it is not used 




- Source field is never null 




- Deriving value of AddionalFields#deleted automatically instead of requiring explicit value 




- Fixed KCB -> KBC typos 




- Not processing heartbeat events 




- Always use size chunking on dedupe 




- Adjusted chunked PG tests to expect multiple slices 




- Refactored TablePerSchemaOrSizeChangeWriter 




- Renamed WriterMode to CaptureMode and documenting it
