**Component:** [kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.0](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.0)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: CDC Processor Update: Enhanced Efficiency and Data Handling
Excerpt: The CDC processor now filters out heartbeat events and uses a consistent size-based chunking method for deduplication, alongside internal optimizations.
Post detail:
We've updated the underlying data processing component for Change Data Capture (CDC). This release focuses on improving processing efficiency and refining internal data handling.

Key changes include the filtering of Debezium heartbeat events. These internal monitoring events are now explicitly ignored, reducing the volume of processed records and ensuring only actual data changes flow through the system. Additionally, the field marking deleted records is now automatically derived from the event type, simplifying internal logic while maintaining data accuracy.

The deduplication process has been standardized to always use size-based chunking. This change impacts how data is grouped internally before deduplication, aiming for more consistent performance and resource management during this phase. Other internal improvements include adjustments to DuckDB memory configuration and significant code refactoring for enhanced maintainability and stability.



## Changes:



- Fixed incrorrect nrStopAfter value in java tests 




- Removed memory_limit DuckDB configuration as it is only alias for max_memory 




- increase max_memory for DuckDB ðŸ¦† 




- Removing unstable fields from heartbeat table csv and excluding it from content comparison in tests 




- Unified and optimized docker images 




- Using Java 21 and unifiying build and runtime distribution 




- Removing duplicit logstash-gelf dependency 




- Removed build-essential from docker image as it is not required 




- Cleaned up notification implementation 




- Initial refactoring of configuration classes 




- Fixed name typo: Dedube -> Dedupe 




- Refactored CDC target and DuckDB configuration 




- Renamed DuckDbWrapper to DuckDbClient 




- Using more descriptive field and method names in state object 




- Simplified and better structured SyncStats methods 




- First cleanup of task shutdown and completion 




- Renamed (duckdb) converters to writers 




- Cleaning up writer implementation 




- Minor config and SnapshotProcessConsumer tweakes 




- Refactoring main processing logic (pt1) 




- Refactoring main processing logic (pt2) 




- Refactoring schema/result loading and saving 




- Added Consumer docs and cleaned up unused attributes 




- Renamed AbstractDebeziumTask as it is not abstract 




- Renamed SnapshotProcessConsumer to more descriptive SnapshotResult 




- Isolated json serialisation (GSON) into single class 




- Removed unwrap transformation from README as it is not used 




- Source field is never null 




- Deriving value of AddionalFields#deleted automatically instead of requiring explicit value 




- Fixed KCB -> KBC typos 




- Not processing heartbeat events 




- Always use size chunking on dedupe 




- Adjusted chunked PG tests to expect multiple slices 




- Refactored TablePerSchemaOrSizeChangeWriter 




- Renamed WriterMode to CaptureMode and documenting it 




- Bump MySQL component version to 0.14.0 




- Bump PostreSQL component version to 0.17.0
