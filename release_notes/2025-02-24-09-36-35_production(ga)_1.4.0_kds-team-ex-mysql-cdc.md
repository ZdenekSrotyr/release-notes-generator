**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Enhancements: Cleaner Output & Optimized Deduplication
Enhancements to CDC components result in cleaner data output and optimized deduplication processes.

We've rolled out updates to our Change Data Capture (CDC) components designed to improve data clarity and processing consistency.

Key changes include:
- **Ignored Heartbeat Events:** To provide cleaner datasets, CDC components now automatically filter out heartbeat events originating from the source database's transaction log. These auxiliary monitoring records will no longer be processed or written to your Keboola Storage tables, focusing the output solely on actual data modifications.
- **Consistent Deduplication:** The deduplication mechanism now consistently uses size-based chunking. This leads to more predictable resource usage during processing, especially beneficial for large tables, while the integrity of the final deduplicated data remains unchanged.

Alongside these functional updates, we've simplified configuration by removing the redundant `memory_limit` setting for internal processing (now solely managed by `max_memory`). Extensive internal code refactoring has also been completed to improve maintainability and stability, supporting the reliability of the component.



## Changes:



- Fixed incrorrect nrStopAfter value in java tests 




- Removed memory_limit DuckDB configuration as it is only alias for max_memory 




- increase max_memory for DuckDB ðŸ¦† 




- Removing unstable fields from heartbeat table csv and excluding it from content comparison in tests 




- Unified and optimized docker images 




- Using Java 21 and unifiying build and runtime distribution 




- Removing duplicit logstash-gelf dependency 




- Removed build-essential from docker image as it is not required 




- Cleaned up notification implementation 




- Initial refactoring of configuration classes 




- Fixed name typo: Dedube -> Dedupe 




- Refactored CDC target and DuckDB configuration 




- Renamed DuckDbWrapper to DuckDbClient 




- Using more descriptive field and method names in state object 




- Simplified and better structured SyncStats methods 




- First cleanup of task shutdown and completion 




- Renamed (duckdb) converters to writers 




- Cleaning up writer implementation 




- Minor config and SnapshotProcessConsumer tweakes 




- Refactoring main processing logic (pt1) 




- Refactoring main processing logic (pt2) 




- Refactoring schema/result loading and saving 




- Added Consumer docs and cleaned up unused attributes 




- Renamed AbstractDebeziumTask as it is not abstract 




- Renamed SnapshotProcessConsumer to more descriptive SnapshotResult 




- Isolated json serialisation (GSON) into single class 




- Removed unwrap transformation from README as it is not used 




- Source field is never null 




- Deriving value of AddionalFields#deleted automatically instead of requiring explicit value 




- Fixed KCB -> KBC typos 




- Not processing heartbeat events 




- Always use size chunking on dedupe 




- Adjusted chunked PG tests to expect multiple slices 




- Refactored TablePerSchemaOrSizeChangeWriter 




- Renamed WriterMode to CaptureMode and documenting it 




- Bump MySQL component version to 0.14.0 




- Bump PostreSQL component version to 0.17.0
