#  kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc 1.4.0

_Released on 2025-02-24_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.0](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.0)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
Streamline Your CDC: Python Component Update
Enhancements in the Python CDC component focus processing on real data changes and enforce size-based chunking during deduplication.

The Python CDC component (v1.4.0) introduces refinements to its data processing logic. Firstly, Debezium heartbeat messages, which indicate connection health rather than data modifications, are now explicitly ignored. This change ensures that processing resources are focused solely on actual data change events (inserts, updates, deletes), leading to cleaner data handling.

Secondly, the internal deduplication process has been standardized. Size-based chunking is now mandatory during deduplication, altering the internal workflow for handling intermediate data. While the final deduplicated output remains consistent, this change standardizes the approach to managing data chunks during this phase.



## Changes:



- Fixed incrorrect nrStopAfter value in java tests 




- Removed memory_limit DuckDB configuration as it is only alias for max_memory 




- increase max_memory for DuckDB ðŸ¦† 




- Removing unstable fields from heartbeat table csv and excluding it from content comparison in tests 




- Unified and optimized docker images 




- Using Java 21 and unifiying build and runtime distribution 




- Removing duplicit logstash-gelf dependency 




- Removed build-essential from docker image as it is not required 




- Cleaned up notification implementation 




- Initial refactoring of configuration classes 




- Fixed name typo: Dedube -> Dedupe 




- Refactored CDC target and DuckDB configuration 




- Renamed DuckDbWrapper to DuckDbClient 




- Using more descriptive field and method names in state object 




- Simplified and better structured SyncStats methods 




- First cleanup of task shutdown and completion 




- Renamed (duckdb) converters to writers 




- Cleaning up writer implementation 




- Minor config and SnapshotProcessConsumer tweakes 




- Refactoring main processing logic (pt1) 




- Refactoring main processing logic (pt2) 




- Refactoring schema/result loading and saving 




- Added Consumer docs and cleaned up unused attributes 




- Renamed AbstractDebeziumTask as it is not abstract 




- Renamed SnapshotProcessConsumer to more descriptive SnapshotResult 




- Isolated json serialisation (GSON) into single class 




- Removed unwrap transformation from README as it is not used 




- Source field is never null 




- Deriving value of AddionalFields#deleted automatically instead of requiring explicit value 




- Fixed KCB -> KBC typos 




- Not processing heartbeat events 




- Always use size chunking on dedupe 




- Adjusted chunked PG tests to expect multiple slices 




- Refactored TablePerSchemaOrSizeChangeWriter
