## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Component Update: Cleaner Data & Performance Boost
Our CDC components now filter out technical heartbeat events for cleaner output and include performance enhancements for better stability.

We've rolled out updates to our Change Data Capture (CDC) components focused on improving data quality and processing efficiency.

To provide you with cleaner and more relevant data, CDC components will now automatically filter out technical heartbeat events generated by Debezium. This means less noise in your output tables, allowing you to focus solely on the actual data changes.

Additionally, we've optimized internal processing steps, including memory management during data handling and the strategy used for deduplication. These behind-the-scenes enhancements are designed to improve performance and stability, particularly when dealing with large datasets or high volumes of changes.

These updates, along with ongoing code refinements, contribute to a more robust and efficient CDC experience in Keboola.



## Changes:
