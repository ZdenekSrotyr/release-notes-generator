## Change log (AI generated):
## Streamlined Component Execution: Run Multiple Transformations Sequentially
Components can now execute a series of transformations sequentially from a single configuration, simplifying workflow setup.

We've updated how certain components handle configurations involving multiple transformations. Previously, defining multiple transformations often meant creating separate configuration rows, each triggering an independent component run.

With this enhancement, you can now define a list of transformations directly within a single configuration structure. The component will read this list and execute each transformation sequentially, one after the other, all within a single component run.

This change streamlines the setup for multi-step transformation processes within a single component configuration. It consolidates execution into one run instead of multiple separate ones, altering the processing flow. Please note that since transformations now run sequentially within the same instance, this may affect how state is managed or passed between them compared to the previous model of isolated runs per configuration row.
