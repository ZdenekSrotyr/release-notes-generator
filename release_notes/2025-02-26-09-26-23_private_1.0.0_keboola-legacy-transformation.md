## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Run All Transformations in a Bucket

Excerpt: Execute all transformations linked to a Storage API bucket with a single configuration parameter.

Post detail:
We've introduced a new way to manage transformation executions. You can now configure the component to run all transformations associated with a specific Storage API bucket by simply providing a `bucket` parameter in the configuration.

Previously, the component only executed transformations explicitly defined within the configuration rows. With this update, using the `bucket` parameter directs the component to find and execute every transformation linked to that bucket. If the `bucket` parameter is not used, the component behaves as before, running only the transformations specified in the configuration rows. This enhancement allows for streamlined execution when you need to process all transformations tied to a particular bucket without listing them individually.
