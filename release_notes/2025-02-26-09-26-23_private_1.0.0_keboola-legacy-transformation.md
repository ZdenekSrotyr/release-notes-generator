## Change log (AI generated):
## Refined Transformation Configuration Handling
Processing for transformation configurations is now streamlined, expecting a single structure per bucket for clarity and consistency.

We have updated how transformation configurations are loaded and processed within relevant components.
Previously, the system could potentially interpret transformation definitions spread across multiple configuration rows for a single bucket. Now, the component expects and processes all transformations for a specific bucket based on a single, consolidated configuration structure.
This change simplifies configuration management and ensures a clearer definition of the transformations applied to each bucket. Please review your configurations, especially if you previously relied on defining transformations across multiple rows for one bucket, as the order or set of executed transformations might be affected by this update.
