## Change log (AI generated):
Unified Transformation Configuration
Introduces a consolidated approach to managing transformation configurations per bucket.

We have updated the way transformation configurations are managed within the platform. This change focuses on consolidating how configurations for transformations within a single bucket are stored and accessed.

This update modifies the internal process for loading execution parameters and discovering the transformations scheduled to run. While this affects the configuration handling workflow, the core data processing logic for SQL, Python, or R transformations remains unaffected by this specific change. The resulting data transformations will be the same, provided the effective configuration details loaded are equivalent to the previous setup.



## Changes:



- tests: exclude RunModeTest 




- tests: exclude sandbox related tests 




- tests: exclude RunModeTest 2 




- PR #18
