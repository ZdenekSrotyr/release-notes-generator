## Change log (AI generated):
## Streamlined Transformation Configuration Loading
Transformation loading logic now reads definitions primarily from a central configuration structure.

We have modified the logic for identifying and loading transformation configurations within components. The component processing may now prioritize reading transformation definitions from a specific central part of the main configuration parameters (`config.json`).

This change replaces the previous behavior where transformation definitions might have been identified by iterating through separate configuration rows. As a result, only transformations defined within the expected central configuration structure will be executed. This could potentially alter the sequence or the specific set of transformations applied if they were previously defined across multiple configuration rows. Please review your component configurations to ensure transformations are defined in the expected central location.
