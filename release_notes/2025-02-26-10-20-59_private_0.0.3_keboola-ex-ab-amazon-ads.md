## Change log (AI generated):
## Airbyte Writer Now Correctly Serializes Date Objects
The Airbyte writer component now properly handles and formats date-only values during data processing.

We have updated the Airbyte writer component to include serialization support for `datetime.date` objects.

This change ensures that data records containing date objects will now have these values consistently converted to the standard ISO 8601 string format (e.g., "2023-10-26") during the writing process. Previously, these specific date objects might not have been explicitly serialized, leading to potential inconsistencies.



## Changes:



- fix deploy pipeline 




- incerase version
