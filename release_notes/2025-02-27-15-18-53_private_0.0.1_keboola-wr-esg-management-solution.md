## Change log (AI generated):
## Introducing ESG Data Extractor

Easily extract Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) data from external sources directly into your Keboola Storage.

We are introducing a new component designed for ESG data integration. This initial version establishes the core functionality to connect to external ESG data sources using API credentials provided in the configuration.

The component fetches data based on parameters you define, such as specific companies, metrics, and time periods. It processes the API response and writes the resulting data into a designated output table (`out.c-esg.tableName`) in Keboola Storage, using `company`, `metric`, and `period` as primary keys. Configuration handling allows you to securely input API tokens and define the scope of the data extraction, controlling exactly what information is retrieved. The basic component structure and entry point have also been set up, enabling the component to run within the Keboola platform.
