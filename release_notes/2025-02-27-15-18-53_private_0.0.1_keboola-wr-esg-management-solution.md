## Reliable Stock Data with New EOD Historical Data Connector
Easily fetch end-of-day stock data from eodhistoricaldata.com reliably into Keboola Storage.

We are excited to introduce the new EOD Historical Data Connector, designed to simplify fetching financial market data directly into your Keboola projects. This component connects to the `eodhistoricaldata.com` API to retrieve daily stock information based on the stock `symbol`, `start_date`, and `end_date` you configure.

The connector processes the API response, extracting key metrics like date, open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume, then writes this valuable data into a structured CSV file ready for use in Keboola Storage Output Tables. This provides a straightforward way to incorporate time-series stock data into your analyses and workflows.

Furthermore, we've built in robust error handling. The connector automatically retries requests in case of temporary network issues or common server errors (like 429, 500, 502, 503, 504), making the data ingestion process significantly more resilient and reliable. Input date validation has also been added to prevent configuration errors, ensuring smoother operation.
