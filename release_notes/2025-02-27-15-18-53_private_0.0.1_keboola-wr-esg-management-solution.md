## Change log (AI generated):
## New ESG Data Extractor Available
A new extractor is now available, providing the core functionality to fetch ESG data and load it into Keboola Storage.

We are releasing the initial version (0.0.1) of a new data extractor component, designed to fetch data from an ESG source.

This release establishes the fundamental workflow for the component. It includes the core logic (`src/component.py`, `main.py`) to read user configuration (`config.json`), interact with the target data source to extract data (`src/extractor.py`) based on specified parameters, and manage the creation and population of output tables in Keboola Storage.

The component defines the structure for the output tables, including columns and primary keys, through manifest files (`src/manifests.py`). It also incorporates utility functions (`src/utils.py`) that may be used for data handling during the extraction process and includes custom error handling (`src/exceptions.py`) for improved robustness. Configuration options allow users to control which data is retrieved from the source.
