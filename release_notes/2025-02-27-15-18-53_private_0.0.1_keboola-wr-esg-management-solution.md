## Change log (AI generated):
Title: New Component: Import External Data via URL

Excerpt: Automate the ingestion of external datasets available via URLs, including CSVs and ZIP archives.

Post detail:
We've introduced a new component designed to streamline the process of bringing external data into your Keboola projects. This component automates the fetching of data directly from a specified source URL.

It intelligently handles different download scenarios, including direct file downloads and extracting specific file types, such as CSVs, from ZIP archives, with built-in retry logic. Once downloaded, the component extracts the data, parsing files based on configured delimiters and managing potential encoding issues to structure the raw information.

Following extraction, the data undergoes transformation. This step cleans and standardizes the information, automatically detecting and converting data types (integer, float, date, string) and handling empty values appropriately. Finally, the processed data is written to specified output tables within Keboola Connection, complete with automatically defined table structures and metadata. The entire workflow, from download to table writing, is orchestrated by the component and configurable through its parameters.
