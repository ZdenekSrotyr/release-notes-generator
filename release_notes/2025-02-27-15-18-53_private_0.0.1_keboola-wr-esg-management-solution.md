## From Image to Insight: New OCR Extractor

Extract structured data directly from images using our new Optical Character Recognition (OCR) extractor.

Tired of manually transcribing data locked away in images like scans, screenshots, or photos? We're excited to introduce the new OCR Extractor component designed to automate this process and bring image-based information directly into your Keboola workflows.

This component leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to read text from image files. Simply provide the path to your image – whether it's stored locally or accessible via a URL – and the extractor will handle the rest. It intelligently downloads images from URLs if needed, performs OCR using the powerful `pytesseract` library, and extracts the raw text content.

But it doesn't stop there. The extractor then transforms this raw, unstructured text into structured tabular data. It intelligently parses the text, identifying rows and columns based on the OCR output structure, effectively converting visual information into a ready-to-use table format (a list of dictionaries internally).

Finally, this structured data is seamlessly written to a CSV file in your Keboola project's output storage, complete with necessary manifest files. This allows you to immediately connect the extracted data to your existing transformations, orchestrations, and analytical tools, integrating previously inaccessible information into your data pipelines. Unlock the potential of your image data today!
