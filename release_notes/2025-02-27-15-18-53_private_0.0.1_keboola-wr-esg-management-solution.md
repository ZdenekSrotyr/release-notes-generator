## New ESG Data Extractor Now Available
Connect to external ESG APIs and load crucial company information and KPI values into structured Keboola tables.

A new ESG Data Extractor component is now available in Keboola.

This component enables you to connect to external ESG data sources via their API. Simply configure the extractor with your API credentials, the specific `company_ids`, and `reporting_periods` for which you need data.

The extractor then automatically fetches the relevant company information and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) values from the source API. The retrieved data is processed and structured into two distinct output tables within your Keboola project: `company_info.csv` for general company details and `kpi_values.csv` for time-series KPI data.

Both tables come with defined primary keys, ensuring the data is ready for immediate analysis and seamless integration into your downstream processing and reporting workflows.
