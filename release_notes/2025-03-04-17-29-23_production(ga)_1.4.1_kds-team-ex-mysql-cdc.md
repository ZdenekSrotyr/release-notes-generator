## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Connector Update: Advanced Debezium Controls & Engine Upgrade
Configure advanced Debezium settings, benefit from the latest engine version, and experience improved compatibility in the updated CDC connector.

This update introduces several enhancements and fixes to improve the functionality and reliability of the Change Data Capture (CDC) connector component.

Users can now fine-tune the underlying Debezium connector by providing custom parameters via a JSON object under the `advanced.debezium` configuration key. This allows for greater control over aspects like filtering, snapshot modes, and data type handling. Error handling for invalid JSON input has also been included.

The core Debezium engine dependency has been upgraded to version `3.0.8.Final`. This incorporates the latest changes, bug fixes, and potential performance improvements from the Debezium project, enhancing connector stability and compatibility.

For MariaDB connections, the component now relies on the Debezium connector's default SSL mode behavior instead of explicitly setting it, potentially altering the default SSL connection strategy if not otherwise configured.

Additionally, compatibility with older state and schema files containing specific typos (`soruce`, `tabel`) has been improved, ensuring smoother resumption of processing from previous states. Minor code refactoring and removal of unused code were also performed for maintainability.
