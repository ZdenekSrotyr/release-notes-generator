## Change log (AI generated):
## Fine-Tune Your CDC with Advanced Debezium Parameters
This update introduces advanced Debezium parameter support for greater CDC customization and includes important compatibility improvements.

Take greater control over your Change Data Capture (CDC) processes with our latest component updates, focusing on advanced configuration and improved reliability.

Unlock deeper customization by providing advanced Debezium parameters directly as a JSON string. This powerful feature allows you to override or merge settings like specific snapshot modes, data transformations, or event filtering, tailoring the CDC behavior to your exact needs. Input validation ensures your custom configuration is correctly formatted.

This update also refines connection handling and compatibility. For MariaDB sources, we now rely on Debezium's default SSL mode instead of explicitly disabling it, potentially affecting connection success based on your server configuration. Furthermore, we've improved robustness by adding fallback logic to correctly load older schema state files containing historical key typos (e.g., `column_propogation`), ensuring seamless operation with past configurations while logging a warning for awareness.



## Changes:
