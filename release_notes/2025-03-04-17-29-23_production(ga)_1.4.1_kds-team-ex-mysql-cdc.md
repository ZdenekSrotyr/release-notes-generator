## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock Advanced Debezium Control in Python CDC
Gain fine-grained control over your CDC process with new advanced Debezium parameters in the Python CDC component.

Take your Change Data Capture (CDC) customization to the next level with the latest Python CDC component update (v1.4.1). We've introduced a new `advanced.parameters` configuration option, allowing you to directly pass raw JSON settings to the underlying Debezium engine. This powerful feature enables fine-grained control over crucial aspects like snapshot modes, event filtering, data type mappings, and other connector-specific properties, letting you precisely tailor how data is captured and processed from your source systems.

Alongside this powerful new feature, version 1.4.1 includes important improvements. We've adjusted the default SSL handling for MariaDB connections to rely on the Debezium connector's standard behavior, which may affect how connections are established depending on your server setup. Additionally, we've enhanced state file compatibility, ensuring the component can seamlessly load schema information (specifically datetime columns) from older state files, preventing potential errors when resuming CDC processes.



## Changes:
