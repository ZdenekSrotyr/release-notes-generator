#  kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc 1.4.1

_Released on 2025-03-04_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.1](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.1)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Fine-Tune Your CDC with Advanced Debezium Settings

Excerpt: Configure advanced Debezium settings directly for more flexible Change Data Capture replication.

Post detail:
You can now gain more granular control over the Debezium CDC component by providing advanced configuration parameters as a JSON string. This allows direct customization of the underlying Debezium engine's behavior, such as specific filtering rules, snapshot modes, or data type handling, offering greater flexibility in how you capture data changes. While the component's core processing logic remains unchanged, these parameters enable you to tailor the data sourcing process to your specific needs.

Alongside this new feature, the component has been updated to use Debezium version 3.0.8.Final. This upgrade incorporates the latest fixes and features from the Debezium project, which may subtly influence behavior based on changes within Debezium itself. Additionally, the component now relies on the underlying Debezium connector's default behavior for handling SSL modes when connecting to MariaDB, rather than setting an explicit default.

We've also improved the component's robustness, ensuring it can successfully load older schema state files even if they contain minor historical typos (like `string` vs. `STRING`), preventing potential errors when resuming processing.
