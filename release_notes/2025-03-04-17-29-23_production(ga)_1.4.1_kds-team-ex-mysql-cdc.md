_Released on 2025-03-04_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.1](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.1)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
Unlock Advanced CDC Tuning & Latest Debezium Features
Gain finer control over Change Data Capture with advanced Debezium parameters and benefit from the latest Debezium core updates.

We've enhanced our Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities, offering you more granular control. You can now provide advanced Debezium connector configuration options directly via a JSON string in the `debezium_advanced_parameters` field. This allows for precise tuning of Debezium's behavior, enabling customized data capture strategies beyond the standard component settings. Input validation ensures robustness against empty or invalid JSON configurations.

Furthermore, the underlying Debezium engine has been upgraded to version `3.0.8.Final`. This update brings the latest fixes, potential performance improvements, and feature enhancements available in Debezium across all supported database types.

For MariaDB connections, the component now relies on Debezium's default SSL mode setting, removing the previous explicit override. This may change how the component connects regarding SSL encryption based on Debezium's defaults.

We've also improved the resilience of state restoration by ensuring the component correctly recognizes older schema formats when loading state files, preventing potential errors during resumption from previous configurations. Unused code has also been removed for simplification.
