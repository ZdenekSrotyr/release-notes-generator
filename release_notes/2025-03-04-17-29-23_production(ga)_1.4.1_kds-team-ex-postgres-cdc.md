#  kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc 1.4.1

_Released on 2025-03-04_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.1](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.1)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Advanced Debezium Configuration & Stability Enhancements

Excerpt: Customize Debezium behavior with advanced parameters and enjoy enhanced configuration stability.

Post detail:
You can now fine-tune the underlying Debezium engine using advanced parameters. Provide a JSON string with key-value pairs to directly configure the Debezium connector, overriding default settings for specialized use cases like adjusting snapshot modes or data type handling.

We've enhanced the validation for these advanced parameters. The system now checks if the input is a valid JSON string and matches the expected structure. If the configuration is invalid, an error is logged, and the component proceeds safely with default settings, preventing potential processing failures due to malformed input.

Additionally, for MariaDB connections, the component now relies on the default SSL mode defined by the Debezium connector itself, removing a previously explicit setting. We've also improved backward compatibility by ensuring that older schema states containing a minor key name typo ('source.with.whitelist') can still be loaded correctly.

These updates, alongside an upgrade to the underlying Debezium library, contribute to greater configuration flexibility and operational robustness.
