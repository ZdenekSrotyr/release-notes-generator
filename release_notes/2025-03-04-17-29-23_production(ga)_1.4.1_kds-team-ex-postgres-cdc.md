**Component:** [kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.1](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.1)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock Advanced Debezium Settings in CDC Component
Gain finer control over CDC with advanced Debezium settings, alongside MariaDB SSL updates and enhanced schema tolerance.

This update to the Python CDC Component (v1.4.1) introduces the `advanced_debezium_params` configuration option. This feature allows you to specify custom key-value pairs as a JSON object, which are passed directly to the underlying Debezium connector configuration. It enables more granular control over Debezium's behavior, potentially altering how changes are captured, filtered, or formatted based on the specific Debezium parameters used. The component includes logic to parse and validate this input.

Furthermore, the component's handling of MariaDB SSL mode has been adjusted. It no longer sets an explicit default SSL mode, relying instead on Debezium's default settings. This might affect connection behavior or security for MariaDB sources if no explicit SSL mode is configured. We have also improved the loading of older state schema files (`schema.json`) to handle minor historical inconsistencies, enhancing backward compatibility and ensuring the correct schema context is used when resuming CDC processing.



## Changes:



- Add MariaDB into description 




- access to advanced Debezium parameters via JSON 




- advanced Debezium parameters via UI + ruff 




- handle invalid or empty advanced parameters value

- Using Debezium's default mariadb ssl mode 




- Removed unused KeboolaProperties class (replaced by KeboolaConfig) 




- Ability to load older schema file with typos (see #3640535) 




- Removed unused code 




- Updated datadirtest depedency 




- Renamed class used to create functional tests to expected TestFunctional 




- Cleanup after component tests
