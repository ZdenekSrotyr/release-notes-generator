## Fine-Tune Your CDC: Advanced Parameters & Engine Upgrade
Gain granular control over your Change Data Capture streams with new advanced settings and enjoy enhanced stability from core engine updates.

We've released an update (v1.4.1) to our Change Data Capture (CDC) components, bringing more control and improved reliability to your data replication pipelines.

This update introduces the ability to specify `advancedDebeziumProps` directly in your component configuration. This powerful feature allows you to pass custom parameters as a JSON string, merging them into the underlying Debezium connector configuration. You can now override default settings and fine-tune low-level Debezium behavior, such as snapshot modes, event processing buffers, or specific connector properties. This gives you granular control to optimize performance, precisely define the scope of captured data, or handle unique database features. Robust error handling for invalid JSON input prevents configuration issues.

Furthermore, we've upgraded the core Debezium engine libraries to version 3.0.8.Final. This incorporates the latest bug fixes, features, and performance enhancements from the Debezium project, potentially improving the reliability and efficiency of data capture, especially for edge cases or newly supported database functionalities.

For smoother upgrades, this release also improves backward compatibility when loading existing CDC state files, ensuring the component correctly recognizes older configuration keys and resumes processing seamlessly. Additionally, we've aligned the default SSL handling for MariaDB connections (when SSL is disabled) with Debezium's standard behavior for better compatibility.
