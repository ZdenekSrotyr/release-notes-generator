#  kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc 1.4.1

_Released on 2025-03-04_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.1](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.1)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock Advanced CDC Control with Debezium v3.0.8

Gain finer control over Change Data Capture with new advanced Debezium parameters and benefit from the latest Debezium engine v3.0.8.

This update introduces the `advanced_debezium_params` parameter, allowing you to provide custom Debezium connector configurations as a JSON string. These settings merge with the component's defaults, offering fine-grained control over Debezium's data capture behavior, potentially affecting filtering, data type conversions, snapshot behavior, and other core CDC mechanisms. Robust error handling has been added to manage invalid JSON or empty values for this parameter, logging issues and falling back to defaults.

We have upgraded the underlying Debezium engine to version `3.0.8.Final`. This update brings the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements from the Debezium project, potentially altering how change data is captured and processed. Additionally, the component now relies on the default Debezium connector behavior for MariaDB SSL connections, no longer explicitly disabling SSL mode. This may affect connectivity depending on server configuration and Debezium's defaults.

Compatibility with older state files has been improved. The component now correctly loads state files containing a previous typo (`lastSchema` instead of `last_schema`), ensuring smooth resumption of CDC streams and preventing potential reprocessing or state loading failures.
