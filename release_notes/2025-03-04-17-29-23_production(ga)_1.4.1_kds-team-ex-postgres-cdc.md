## Change log (AI generated):
## Fine-Tune Your CDC: Advanced Parameters & Engine Upgrade
Gain deeper control over CDC behavior with advanced Debezium parameters and benefit from an upgraded, more robust engine.

This update introduces significant enhancements to our Change Data Capture (CDC) components, empowering you with greater configuration flexibility and improved reliability.

You can now directly pass advanced Debezium parameters via a JSON structure within the component configuration. This allows for fine-grained control over the underlying Debezium engine, enabling you to customize behaviors like snapshot modes, data type conversions, topic routing, and filtering options to precisely match your specific data replication needs.

We've also upgraded the core Debezium engine to version `3.0.8.Final`. This brings the latest fixes, performance improvements, and feature refinements from the Debezium project, ensuring a more stable and efficient CDC process. Additionally, we've improved the component's robustness by enabling it to load older state and schema files containing certain typos, ensuring smoother upgrades and restarts without interrupting your data flow. For MariaDB users, SSL mode handling now aligns more closely with Debezium defaults for better compatibility, unless specifically overridden using the new advanced parameters.



## Changes:



- Add MariaDB into description 




- access to advanced Debezium parameters via JSON 




- advanced Debezium parameters via UI + ruff 




- handle invalid or empty advanced parameters value 




- updated docstring 




- Upgrading debezium to 3.0.8.Final (SUPPORT-10937) 




- Using Debezium's default mariadb ssl mode 




- Removed unused KeboolaProperties class (replaced by KeboolaConfig) 




- Ability to load older schema file with typos (see #3640535) 




- Removed unused code 




- Updated datadirtest depedency 




- Renamed class used to create functional tests to expected TestFunctional 




- Cleanup after component tests
