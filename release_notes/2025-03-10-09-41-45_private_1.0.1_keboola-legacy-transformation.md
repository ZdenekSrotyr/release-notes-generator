## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Reporting in Snowflake Transformations
Snowflake transformations now feature improved error handling for more reliable failure reporting.

We've enhanced the error handling for Snowflake transformations to improve reliability.

The update focuses on the PHP orchestration layer surrounding the transformation code. Specifically, PHP warnings and notices related to Snowflake database operations are now converted into exceptions (`ErrorException` or `UserException`).

This means that potential issues during Snowflake interactions, which might have previously only generated a warning, will now cause the transformation job to fail explicitly with a clear error message. This change leads to more robust and predictable behavior when errors occur during Snowflake operations.

The core data transformation logic executed by Python remains unchanged.



## Changes:



- fix(snowflake): throw exceptions for odbc_exec errors instead of PHP warnings 




- fix: set error handler properly 




- PR #19
