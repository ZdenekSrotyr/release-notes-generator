Legacy Transformation Stability Improvements
Minor update enhances internal error handling for the Legacy Transformation component; transformation logic remains unchanged.

We have released a minor update (v1.0.1) for the Legacy Transformation component. This version introduces refinements to internal error handling mechanisms, contributing to improved component stability and reliability.

Please note that this update does not affect the core data processing logic; your transformations will run exactly as they did previously. These behind-the-scenes adjustments aim to provide a more robust experience when using legacy transformations.



## Changes:



- fix(snowflake): throw exceptions for odbc_exec errors instead of PHP warnings 




- fix: set error handler properly 




- PR #19
