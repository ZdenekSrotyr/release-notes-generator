## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Stability for Snowflake Connections
This update enhances the robustness of Snowflake operations by improving internal error handling.

We've rolled out a minor update focused on improving the stability and reliability of interactions with Snowflake. This change specifically addresses how PHP warnings generated during Snowflake ODBC operations are managed.

Previously, certain warnings might not have explicitly halted processes, potentially masking underlying issues. With this update, these specific warnings are now converted into exceptions. This ensures that potential problems are surfaced clearly and immediately, leading to more predictable and robust behavior when connecting to and working with Snowflake.

This is an internal enhancement targeting error handling mechanisms and does not introduce changes to the core data processing logic within our components.



## Changes:



- fix(snowflake): throw exceptions for odbc_exec errors instead of PHP warnings 




- fix: set error handler properly 




- PR #19
