## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Refined Snowflake Error Handling

Excerpt: This update enhances the error handling mechanism specifically for Snowflake connections.

Post detail:
We have released an update focusing on improving the stability and clarity of interactions with Snowflake.

This version introduces changes to the underlying PHP code responsible for managing Snowflake connection errors. While the core data processing logic in Python remains unchanged, this refinement ensures more robust handling of potential issues encountered during Snowflake operations, leading to clearer diagnostics when problems occur.



## Changes:



- fix(snowflake): throw exceptions for odbc_exec errors instead of PHP warnings 




- fix: set error handler properly 




- PR #19
