## Change log (AI generated):
## Faster, More Robust Jira Data Extractions
Updates to our Jira data extraction components improve data retrieval speed and provide more informative error messages.

We've recently rolled out significant under-the-hood improvements to how we fetch data from Jira. These enhancements focus on making your data pipelines faster and more reliable without changing the data you receive.

First, we've upgraded the underlying mechanism for making API requests to Jira by implementing an asynchronous HTTP client. This allows for more efficient handling of network communication, potentially speeding up your data extractions, particularly for larger jobs involving numerous requests.

Second, we've refined our error handling. When issues occur during data retrieval due to HTTP errors from the Jira API (such as 'Not Found' or 'Server Error'), you will now receive clearer, more user-friendly error messages directly within Keboola. This improvement aims to make troubleshooting connection or request problems much simpler.

These updates enhance the performance and stability of the data fetching process but do not alter the structure or content of the successfully extracted Jira data. Enjoy smoother and more transparent data operations.
