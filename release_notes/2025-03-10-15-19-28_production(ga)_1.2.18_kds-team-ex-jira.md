**Component:** [kds-team.ex-jira](https://github.com/keboola/component-jira)  
**Tag:** [1.2.18](https://github.com/keboola/component-jira/releases/tag/1.2.18)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Jira Extractor: Performance & Error Handling Boost
Excerpt: Updates to the Jira extractor enhance performance and provide clearer error feedback.
Post detail:
We've implemented internal improvements to the Jira extractor focusing on efficiency and user experience during setup and troubleshooting.

The underlying HTTP client used for making API calls to Jira has been upgraded to an asynchronous version. This change is designed to improve the component's performance and concurrency when fetching data, although the structure and content of the extracted data remain unchanged.

Additionally, error handling for API communication has been refined. Specific HTTP errors encountered during API calls will now trigger more user-friendly exception messages, making it easier to diagnose issues related to connectivity or permissions with the Jira API. This change does not affect data processing under normal operating conditions.
