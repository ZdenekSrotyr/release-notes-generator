## Change log (AI generated):
## Updated Jira Connector: Asynchronous Requests and Better Error Handling
We've updated the Jira connector's internal workings for improved performance and error reporting.

The Jira connector has received internal updates to enhance its operation.

We have replaced the underlying synchronous HTTP client with an asynchronous one (`httpx.AsyncClient`) for interacting with the Jira API (commit `0ceae235`). This change facilitates asynchronous API requests, which can lead to improved performance, especially when handling multiple requests concurrently. The data retrieved from Jira remains unchanged by this update.

Additionally, error handling for Jira API calls has been refined (commit `21f3333c`). Specific HTTP errors encountered during API requests (such as 4xx or 5xx status codes) are now explicitly caught and re-raised as `keboola.component.UserException`. This provides more direct and classified user-facing error messages when API communication issues occur, distinguishing them from other potential component failures. This change does not affect the processing logic for successful API calls.
