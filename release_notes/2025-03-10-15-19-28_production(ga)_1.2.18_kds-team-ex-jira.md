## Change log (AI generated):
## Jira Extractor: Faster Data Extraction & Improved Error Handling
Fetch your Jira data more quickly with concurrent processing and benefit from clearer error reporting for smoother extractions.

We've upgraded the Jira Extractor to fetch data more efficiently. By leveraging asynchronous processing, the component now fetches data for multiple JQL queries concurrently instead of sequentially. This significantly speeds up the data extraction process, especially for configurations with numerous queries. The update also introduces automatic retries for certain Jira API errors, improving reliability.

Alongside the performance improvements, we've enhanced how the extractor handles errors from the Jira API. If specific API issues occur during data fetching (like permission errors), the component will now provide clearer, more informative error messages derived directly from the Jira API response, helping you diagnose and resolve configuration problems faster.
