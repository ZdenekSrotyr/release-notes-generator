## Change log (AI generated):
## Jira Extractor: Improved Reliability and Performance
This update enhances the Jira extractor with clearer error reporting and potential performance improvements through internal upgrades.

We've rolled out an update to the Jira extractor focusing on improving its stability and efficiency.

You'll now benefit from more specific error handling. If the extractor encounters issues communicating with the Jira API (like 4xx or 5xx errors), it will now provide clearer, user-friendly error messages, making it easier to diagnose configuration or connection problems.

Additionally, we've upgraded the underlying mechanism for fetching data from Jira to an asynchronous process. This internal change is designed to potentially improve the speed and efficiency of your data extractions, especially for larger jobs.
