## Jira Extractor Performance and Reliability Update
Internal upgrades to the Jira Extractor enhance performance potential via asynchronous operations and improve error reporting.

We've implemented significant internal enhancements to the Jira Extractor component focused on improving performance and reliability when interacting with the Jira API.

The component now utilizes an asynchronous HTTP client (`httpx`) for making requests to the Jira API. This change modernizes the underlying data retrieval mechanism, potentially leading to improved efficiency and concurrency, especially for larger data extractions. While this changes *how* the data is fetched, the structure and content of your successfully extracted Jira data remain unaffected.

Additionally, we've refined the component's error handling. It now specifically catches HTTP status errors returned by the Jira API (such as 4xx client errors or 5xx server errors) and raises clearer `UserException` messages. This improvement makes it easier to diagnose and troubleshoot problems related to API access or request issues, leading to a more robust data extraction process.
