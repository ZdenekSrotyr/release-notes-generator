## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Asynchronous Client Implementation and Improved HTTPStatusError Handling

Excerpt: Changes in error handling and client behavior may enhance user experience and component performance.

Post Detail: 

1. Error Handling: HTTPStatusErrors are now caught and a UserException is raised instead. This modification may improve the clarity of error reporting to users.

2. Configuration: New files have been added to the component_config directory including loggerConfiguration.json and logger. The impact of these additions is currently unclear without further information.

3. Component Behavior: The client used by the component has been switched to an asynchronous one. This change could potentially enhance the performance of the component by enabling concurrent task handling.

The exact impact of these changes may differ based on the specific use case and configuration of the component.
