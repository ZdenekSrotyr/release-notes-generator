Title: Improved Data Type Handling and Query Optimization

Excerpt: Enhancements include data type autodetection, simplified solutions, optimized queries, and dtype changes to INTEGER and VARCHAR.

Post Detail: In this update, we have streamlined the data type autodetection process and simplified the solution for better user experience. Additionally, we have optimized queries by moving them to a more efficient location within the save_to_table function.
