## Change log (AI generated):
## Standardized String Data Type Handling for CSV Files
CSV file imports now consistently treat all columns as strings (VARCHAR), preventing automatic type conversion and standard NaN interpretation during loading.

We have updated how CSV files are processed to ensure consistent data type handling.

When reading CSV files, all columns are now explicitly treated as string (VARCHAR) data types. This change uses parameters (`na_filter=False`, `keep_default_na=False`, `dtype=str`) to prevent the automatic interpretation of values like "NA" as missing data (NULL/NaN) and stops unintended conversions of source data to numeric or boolean types. All source data is loaded as strings.

In alignment with this, when writing dataframes to destination tables, the default data type for newly created columns is now explicitly set to VARCHAR. This ensures consistency between how data is read and how it is stored by default.

Minor code refactoring, including the removal of an unused variable, was also performed but does not impact functionality. These updates standardize the initial handling of CSV data as strings, promoting predictable data loading.
