## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Streamlined Data Ingestion: Defaulting to VARCHAR

Excerpt: Data loading is now more robust by initially treating all incoming columns as VARCHAR, preventing type errors during ingestion.

Post detail:
We've updated the data ingestion process to enhance reliability and simplify handling diverse data sources. After exploring different approaches including data type autodetection, we've standardized the initial loading step: all columns are now treated as VARCHAR during processing and initial table creation. This approach eliminates potential data type conflicts and errors often encountered during the loading phase.

By treating all incoming data as text initially, you get a more consistent loading experience. While this prevents type errors upfront, you may need to explicitly cast data types downstream in your transformations if specific types (like numeric or date) are required for analysis. Additionally, parameters for parsing CSV files have been adjusted for consistency, and the logic for writing data to destination tables has been modified as part of this update.



## Changes:



- data type autodetection and converting 




- back to more simple solution 




- del of unused global variable 




- fixed read_csv parameters 




- copy the query to another part of save_to_table func 




- changed dtype to INTEGER 




- changed dtype to VARCHAR 




- all varchar 




- PR #3
