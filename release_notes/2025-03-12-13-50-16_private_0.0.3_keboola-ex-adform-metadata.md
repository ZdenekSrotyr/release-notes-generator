## Adform Extractor: Simplified Data Type Handling

Updates to the Adform extractor simplify data handling by standardizing all output columns to the string data type.

We've updated the Adform extractor to refine how data is processed and stored in Keboola Storage.

The primary change involves standardizing the data type handling for output tables. Moving forward, all columns extracted from Adform will be explicitly treated and loaded as the `VARCHAR` (string) data type. This adjustment simplifies the data loading process and ensures consistent handling across different Adform reports and fields.

This means that regardless of the original data format in Adform (e.g., numbers, dates), the corresponding columns in your Keboola Storage tables will now have a string type. This change was implemented alongside adjustments to how the extractor reads the source CSV files, ensuring the data is correctly interpreted as strings from the initial parsing step.



## Changes:



- data type autodetection and converting 




- back to more simple solution 




- del of unused global variable 




- fixed read_csv parameters 




- copy the query to another part of save_to_table func
