## Change log (AI generated):
## Adform Extractor Now Reads All Columns as Text
Our Adform extractor has been updated to read all report columns as text (VARCHAR) to improve data loading reliability.

We've updated the Adform extractor to change how it handles data types from your reports. Previously, the extractor might attempt to automatically detect data types (like numbers or dates). Now, it explicitly reads all columns as text strings (VARCHAR) directly from the CSV files provided by Adform.

This change significantly reduces the risk of errors caused by unexpected data formats in specific columns, making the data loading process more robust and reliable. As a result, all data extracted from Adform reports will now appear as text type in your destination tables. You may need to adjust downstream transformations if they previously relied on automatically inferred numeric or date types.

This update also simplifies the internal processing logic. Other minor code refactoring changes were included but do not affect the extractor's functionality.
