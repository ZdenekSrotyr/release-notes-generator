## Adform Extractor Update: Consistent Data Types for Enhanced Reliability
The Adform extractor now ensures consistent data handling by reading and writing all columns as text (VARCHAR) to prevent type errors during processing and loading.

We've updated the Adform extractor component (version 0.0.3) to improve the reliability of data ingestion into Keboola Storage. Previously, the component attempted various methods of detecting data types, which could sometimes lead to inconsistencies or errors, especially with large datasets or unexpected values from the Adform API.

To ensure stable and predictable data loading, the component now implements two key changes:
1.  It reads all data from the downloaded Adform CSV files strictly as text, preventing potential misinterpretations of data types during the initial read phase.
2.  It creates table manifests for Keboola Storage that explicitly define all columns as VARCHAR.

This approach guarantees that data lands reliably in your Storage tables, eliminating errors caused by data type conflicts. While this standardizes the output, please note that all columns will be treated as text; any necessary conversions to specific numeric or date types should be handled downstream in your transformations.
