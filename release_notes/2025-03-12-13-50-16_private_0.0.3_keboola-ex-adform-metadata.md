## Change log (AI generated):
Enhanced CSV Data Processing Stability
Updates improve CSV data loading reliability by standardizing data types to VARCHAR and adjusting parsing parameters.

We've updated the component's data processing logic for enhanced stability when handling CSV files. To prevent potential errors arising from incorrect data type inference, all columns read from source CSV files are now consistently treated as VARCHAR (string) data types during processing. This standardization ensures more predictable behavior when loading diverse datasets.

Additionally, the parameters used for reading input CSV files have been adjusted. These refinements aim to improve the reliability and accuracy of the initial data parsing step from source files. Internal code structure has also been improved through refactoring and cleanup for better maintainability.



## Changes:



- data type autodetection and converting 




- back to more simple solution 




- del of unused global variable 




- fixed read_csv parameters 




- copy the query to another part of save_to_table func 




- changed dtype to INTEGER 




- changed dtype to VARCHAR 




- all varchar 




- PR #3
