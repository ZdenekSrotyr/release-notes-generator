## Adform Extractor Update: Banners-Adgroups Data Enhancement
This update ensures the `banners-adgroups` report always includes a `deleted` column for improved data consistency.

We've updated the Adform Extractor to enhance data reliability for the `banners-adgroups` report. The extractor now automatically checks if a `deleted` column exists in the data fetched from Adform.

If this column is missing, it will be automatically added to your output table, typically with a default value (like False or 0) indicating the ad group is active. This ensures a consistent table structure, making it easier to track the status of your ad groups and simplifying downstream data processing and analysis.

Additionally, this update includes minor internal improvements, such as updating the configuration encryption endpoint and enhancing temporary resource cleanup, contributing to the extractor's overall stability and efficiency.



## Changes:



- add deleted column to banners-adgroups if missing 




- fix encryption endpoint for current stack 




- flake 




- drop table after saving 




- PR #4
