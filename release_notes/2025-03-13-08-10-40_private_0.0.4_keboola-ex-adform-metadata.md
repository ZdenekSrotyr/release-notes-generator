## Change log (AI generated):
Adform Extractor Update: Consistent `banners-adgroups` Data
The Adform extractor now ensures the `deleted` column is always present in the `banners-adgroups` report output for enhanced data consistency.

We've updated the Adform data extractor with improvements focused on data consistency and operational stability.

The primary update ensures that the `banners-adgroups` report output consistently includes a `deleted` column. If the data fetched from Adform for this report type does not contain this column, the extractor will now automatically add it, setting the value to `False` for all rows. This enhancement provides a more predictable data structure for your downstream transformations and analyses.

This release also includes technical refinements for smoother operation. We've adjusted how the component determines the Storage API URL for configuration encryption, relying on environment variables for better compatibility. Furthermore, temporary database tables created during the data extraction process are now automatically dropped upon successful completion, improving resource management within your projects. These internal changes do not affect the final data content beyond the guaranteed `deleted` column in the specific report type.



## Changes:



- add deleted column to banners-adgroups if missing 




- fix encryption endpoint for current stack 




- flake 




- drop table after saving 




- PR #4
