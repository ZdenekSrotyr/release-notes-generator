## Change log (AI generated):
## Adform Reporting: Enhanced `banners-adgroups` Report Schema
Adform Reporting's `banners-adgroups` report now consistently includes a 'deleted' column, enhancing data reliability.

We have released an update to the Adform Reporting component focusing on data consistency and internal improvements.

The most significant change affects the `banners-adgroups` report. To ensure a reliable and consistent output schema, this report will now always include a 'deleted' column in the resulting table. If the source data fetched from the Adform API does not contain this column, it will be automatically added to the output table with a default value of `False` for all rows. This guarantees predictability in the table structure, simplifying downstream data processing.

Additionally, this update includes internal enhancements for improved stability and resource management. We've refined how the component handles encryption services based on the Keboola environment and implemented better cleanup procedures for temporary data used during report generation. These background improvements contribute to the component's overall reliability without affecting the final data output.



## Changes:



- add deleted column to banners-adgroups if missing 




- fix encryption endpoint for current stack 




- flake 




- drop table after saving 




- PR #4
