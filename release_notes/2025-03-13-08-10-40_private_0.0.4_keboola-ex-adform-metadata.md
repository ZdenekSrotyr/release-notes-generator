## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Adform Extractor: Guaranteed 'Deleted' Column

Ensures the 'banners-adgroups' report always includes a 'deleted' column for consistent output table structure.

We have updated the Adform Extractor component to improve data consistency and internal operations.

The primary enhancement involves the `banners-adgroups` report. The component now checks if the 'deleted' column is present in the data retrieved from the Adform API. If this column is missing, it will automatically be added to the output table, with all rows assigned a default value of `False`. This guarantees that the output table for this report always contains the 'deleted' column, simplifying downstream processing.

Additionally, we've made internal updates, including refreshing the URL used for interacting with the Keboola Connection Encryption API and implementing a memory optimization that explicitly removes the data structure after its contents are saved. These internal adjustments do not alter the content or structure of the data extracted from Adform.



## Changes:



- add deleted column to banners-adgroups if missing 




- fix encryption endpoint for current stack 




- flake 




- drop table after saving 




- PR #4
