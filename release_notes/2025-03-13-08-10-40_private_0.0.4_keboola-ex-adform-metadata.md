## Change log (AI generated):
## Adform Extractor: `deleted` Column Guaranteed in `banners-adgroups`
The Adform extractor now ensures the `deleted` column is always present in the `banners-adgroups` output table for schema consistency.

The Adform extractor has been updated to improve data consistency for the `banners-adgroups` endpoint. Previously, the presence of the `deleted` column depended on whether it was included in the data fetched from the Adform API.

This update introduces logic that checks for the `deleted` column in the fetched `banners-adgroups` data. If the column is missing, it will now be automatically added to the output table and populated with a default value of `False`. This ensures the `deleted` column always exists in the final table, providing a consistent schema. Note that this may change the output table schema if the column was previously absent.

Additionally, two internal improvements have been made: the component now dynamically determines the Keboola Encryption API URL based on the environment, and temporary database tables are now explicitly dropped after use for better resource cleanup. These internal changes do not affect the structure or content of the data extracted from Adform.



## Changes:



- add deleted column to banners-adgroups if missing 




- fix encryption endpoint for current stack 




- flake 




- drop table after saving 




- PR #4
