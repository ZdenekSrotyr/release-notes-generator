## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Adform Extractor: Guaranteed 'deleted' Column in `banners-adgroups`

**Excerpt:** The `banners-adgroups` output table from the Adform extractor now consistently includes a 'deleted' column.

**Post Detail:**
We have updated the Adform extractor to enhance the consistency of the `banners-adgroups` report output. The extractor logic now ensures that the output table for this report will always contain a 'deleted' column, even if this column is not present in the data retrieved directly from the Adform API. This change standardizes the schema for downstream processing.

Additionally, internal improvements have been made. We updated the endpoint used for Keboola encryption services to maintain compatibility with the current stack environment. We also added a step to explicitly clean up temporary tables used during data processing, improving resource management. These internal changes do not affect the Adform data processing logic or the final output data, apart from the guaranteed presence of the 'deleted' column in the `banners-adgroups` table.



## Changes:



- add deleted column to banners-adgroups if missing 




- fix encryption endpoint for current stack 




- flake 




- drop table after saving 




- PR #4
