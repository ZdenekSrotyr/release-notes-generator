## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Update: No Functional Changes, Internal Improvements Only
This update includes internal tooling improvements and CI/CD migration, with no changes to core data processing functionality.

This component update focuses purely on internal improvements and maintenance, with no changes to its core data processing functionality. You can continue using the component exactly as before.

We have migrated our internal continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) processes from Bitbucket Pipelines to GitHub Actions. This switch enhances our development workflow, allowing for faster and more reliable updates behind the scenes.

Additionally, we've updated configuration files related to how this component is displayed and managed within the Keboola Developer Portal. These changes improve internal tooling and ensure better consistency in our component listings.

Rest assured, these updates do not impact the component's performance, features, or how you interact with it for your data tasks. They are part of our ongoing efforts to maintain and improve our internal systems.
