## Change log (AI generated):
## New 'Gross Revenue' Metric Option Available
Easily select the 'Gross Revenue' metric directly within the component's configuration interface.

We've updated the configuration interface for this component. You can now select 'Gross Revenue' as a metric option directly within the settings.

This update involves changes to the configuration schema files, enabling the new metric selection in the user interface. Please note that the underlying data processing logic of the component remains unchanged in this version; this update specifically adds the option to the configuration settings.

Other internal improvements in this release include migrating our CI/CD pipeline to GitHub Actions, updating build configurations, and adding documentation files, none of which affect the component's core functionality.
