## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Maintenance: Internal Updates & Documentation
This component update focuses on internal tooling, documentation, and CI/CD enhancements, with no impact on runtime data processing.

This release contains internal improvements aimed at enhancing the component's maintainability and developer experience. There are no changes to the component's core Python code or its data processing logic during runtime.

Key changes include the addition of standard documentation files (`README.md`, documentation URLs, license information) and sample configuration files to make understanding and using the component easier for developers. We have also migrated our internal build and test processes from Bitbucket Pipelines to GitHub Actions for better CI/CD infrastructure and added internal scripts to streamline updates to our developer portal. Tests have been updated accordingly.

These updates ensure the component remains robust, well-documented, and easier to maintain, but they do not affect its operational behavior or require any changes to your existing configurations.
