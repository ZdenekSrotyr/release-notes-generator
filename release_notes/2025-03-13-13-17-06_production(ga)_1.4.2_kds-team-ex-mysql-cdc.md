## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced CDC Reliability: Snapshotting Fix and PostgreSQL Compatibility
Improved Change Data Capture stability with fixes for snapshotting behavior and enhanced PostgreSQL setup compatibility.

We've implemented key improvements to enhance the reliability of our Change Data Capture (CDC) components.

A fix has been applied to correct the snapshotting behavior in `chunked_blocking` mode. This prevents the system from unnecessarily triggering a re-snapshot after the initial phase completes, avoiding potential duplicate data capture and ensuring a smoother transition from snapshotting to streaming.

For PostgreSQL users, we've added specific logic to respect the database's limits on identifier lengths for replication slots and publications. This enhancement ensures correct component setup with PostgreSQL, preventing potential configuration failures that could block data processing.

Additionally, minor adjustments were made to logging behavior for optional configurations and internal code refinements were implemented for better maintainability. These changes do not affect data processing logic.



## Changes:



- fix snapshotting in chunked_blocking mode 




- include common folders in docker compose dev service 




- cleanup (remove commented out lines) 




- add missing abstract methods overrides for PostgreSQL & update tests 




- don't scare users by warnings for empty advanced parameters üëª 




- abstract method's typing matches implementation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- cleanup üßπ 




- MySQL 0.14.2 / PostgreSQL 0.17.2
