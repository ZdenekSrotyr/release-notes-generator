## CDC Update: Snapshot and PostgreSQL Reliability Fixes
Recent updates enhance Change Data Capture reliability by correcting snapshot behavior in specific modes and improving PostgreSQL replication accuracy.

We have released updates to our Change Data Capture (CDC) components focused on improving operational reliability and data accuracy.

Specifically, we addressed an issue in the `chunked_blocking` snapshot mode where an unnecessary second full table snapshot could be triggered after the initial one completed. The signalling logic has been corrected to prevent this, ensuring a proper transition to incremental change capture without potential data reprocessing.

Additionally, we have implemented specific handling for PostgreSQL Log Sequence Numbers (LSNs). Accurate formatting and parsing of LSNs are now ensured, which is critical for correctly tracking the replication state and preventing missed or duplicated change events during incremental processing for PostgreSQL sources.

Minor logging improvements were also made to reduce warnings related to empty advanced configuration parameters. These changes collectively contribute to a more robust and accurate CDC experience.



## Changes:



- fix snapshotting in chunked_blocking mode 




- include common folders in docker compose dev service 




- cleanup (remove commented out lines) 




- add missing abstract methods overrides for PostgreSQL & update tests 




- don't scare users by warnings for empty advanced parameters üëª 




- abstract method's typing matches implementation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- cleanup üßπ 




- MySQL 0.14.2 / PostgreSQL 0.17.2
