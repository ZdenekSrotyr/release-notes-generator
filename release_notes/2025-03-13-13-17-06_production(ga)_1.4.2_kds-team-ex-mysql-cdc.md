**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Improved CDC Reliability: Snapshotting Fix & PostgreSQL Enhancements

Excerpt: Enhanced the CDC component's reliability with a crucial snapshotting fix and improved PostgreSQL integration.

Post detail:
We've resolved an issue within the Change Data Capture (CDC) component related to data snapshotting. Previously, when using the `chunked_blocking` mode, an incorrect signal could trigger a redundant full table snapshot after the initial one completed. This update corrects the behavior, ensuring snapshots occur only as intended and preventing unnecessary processing load.

Additionally, we have improved support for PostgreSQL data sources. Specific implementations required for seamless interaction with PostgreSQL have been added, enhancing the reliability and setup process when using CDC with this database.

As a minor improvement, warnings related to empty optional advanced configuration parameters are now suppressed, leading to cleaner component logs without affecting data processing.



## Changes:



- fix snapshotting in chunked_blocking mode 




- include common folders in docker compose dev service 




- cleanup (remove commented out lines) 




- add missing abstract methods overrides for PostgreSQL & update tests 




- don't scare users by warnings for empty advanced parameters üëª 




- abstract method's typing matches implementation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- cleanup üßπ 




- MySQL 0.14.2 / PostgreSQL 0.17.2
