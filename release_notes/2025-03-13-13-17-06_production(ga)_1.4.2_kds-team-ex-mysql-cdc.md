#  kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc 1.4.2

_Released on 2025-03-13_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.2](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.2)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved CDC Connector Reliability and Efficiency
This update fixes snapshot behavior in chunked_blocking mode and enhances PostgreSQL replication tracking for more reliable Change Data Capture.

We've rolled out several improvements to our Change Data Capture (CDC) components to enhance reliability and efficiency.

Firstly, we addressed an issue in the `chunked_blocking` snapshot mode where the component could incorrectly trigger a new full snapshot immediately after completing the initial one. This fix ensures a smoother transition from the initial snapshot to streaming CDC changes, preventing unnecessary full table scans and leading to more efficient and correct data capture continuity.

Secondly, for users leveraging PostgreSQL as a source, we've implemented specific logic to accurately track the database's replication state (Log Sequence Number and Transaction ID). Correctly monitoring LSN/TXID is vital for maintaining data consistency and preventing missed or duplicated data during replication, significantly improving the reliability of data synchronization state management for PostgreSQL.

Finally, we've suppressed some warnings that were previously logged when certain advanced, optional configuration parameters were left empty, reducing unnecessary log noise for users.



## Changes:



- fix snapshotting in chunked_blocking mode 




- include common folders in docker compose dev service 




- cleanup (remove commented out lines) 




- add missing abstract methods overrides for PostgreSQL & update tests 




- don't scare users by warnings for empty advanced parameters üëª 




- abstract method's typing matches implementation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- cleanup üßπ 




- MySQL 0.14.2 / PostgreSQL 0.17.2
