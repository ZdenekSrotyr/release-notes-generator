## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Update: Corrected Snapshot Behavior & Enhancements
Enhanced CDC component reliability with corrected snapshot logic and other stability improvements.

We've released an update to our Change Data Capture (CDC) components focusing on improved reliability and user experience.

A key correction addresses the snapshot behavior when using the `chunked_blocking` mode. Previously, the component could incorrectly trigger a new full snapshot after the initial one completed. This update ensures that once the initial snapshot finishes, the component correctly switches to processing only incremental changes (inserts, updates, deletes), preventing unnecessary and resource-intensive re-snapshotting cycles.

Additionally, this release includes specific method implementations for PostgreSQL, enhancing compatibility and ensuring correct database interactions when using PostgreSQL as a source. We've also adjusted warning logs, suppressing notifications for certain advanced configuration parameters intentionally left empty by users, leading to cleaner logs.



## Changes:



- fix snapshotting in chunked_blocking mode 




- include common folders in docker compose dev service 




- cleanup (remove commented out lines) 




- add missing abstract methods overrides for PostgreSQL & update tests 




- don't scare users by warnings for empty advanced parameters üëª 




- abstract method's typing matches implementation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- cleanup üßπ 




- MySQL 0.14.2 / PostgreSQL 0.17.2
