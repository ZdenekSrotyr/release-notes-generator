**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Component Update: Reliable Snapshots & PostgreSQL Support
Updates to CDC components prevent unnecessary table re-snapshots and ensure accurate PostgreSQL metadata retrieval.

We've released an update for our Change Data Capture (CDC) components focusing on improved stability and enhanced support for specific database types.

A key fix addresses an issue in `chunked_blocking` mode where the component could incorrectly signal for a full table re-snapshot immediately after the initial snapshot completed. This correction prevents these unnecessary re-snapshots, ensuring a smoother transition to streaming CDC changes after the initial data load.

Additionally, this update introduces specific implementations for retrieving metadata (table lists, column details, primary keys) and source information directly from PostgreSQL databases. This ensures more accurate setup and reliable data capture when using CDC with PostgreSQL.

Finally, we've adjusted the logging behaviour to reduce noise by no longer printing warnings when the 'advanced' configuration section is present but empty.



## Changes:



- fix snapshotting in chunked_blocking mode 




- include common folders in docker compose dev service 




- cleanup (remove commented out lines) 




- add missing abstract methods overrides for PostgreSQL & update tests 




- don't scare users by warnings for empty advanced parameters üëª 




- abstract method's typing matches implementation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- cleanup üßπ 




- MySQL 0.14.2 / PostgreSQL 0.17.2
