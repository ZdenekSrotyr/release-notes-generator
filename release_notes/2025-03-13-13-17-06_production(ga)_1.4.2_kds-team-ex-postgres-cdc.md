**Component:** [kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.2](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.2)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Component Update: Snapshot Stability and PostgreSQL Enhancements
This update improves the Change Data Capture (CDC) component's reliability, fixing snapshot behavior and enhancing PostgreSQL backend functionality.

We've addressed an issue in `chunked_blocking` mode where the component incorrectly triggered a new data snapshot immediately after the initial one completed. This fix ensures that after the initial load, the component correctly proceeds to capture incremental changes, preventing unnecessary full data re-snapshots and ensuring smoother operation.

Additionally, specific method implementations previously missing for the PostgreSQL backend have been added. This allows PostgreSQL sources to utilize distinct logic tailored for that database, rather than solely relying on the base implementation, potentially affecting database interactions during setup or connection.



## Changes:



- fix snapshotting in chunked_blocking mode 




- include common folders in docker compose dev service 




- cleanup (remove commented out lines) 




- add missing abstract methods overrides for PostgreSQL & update tests 




- don't scare users by warnings for empty advanced parameters üëª 




- abstract method's typing matches implementation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- cleanup üßπ 




- MySQL 0.14.2 / PostgreSQL 0.17.2
