**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## Optimized CDC Chunked Blocking Mode
This update enhances Change Data Capture (CDC) reliability by preventing unnecessary data re-snapshots after the initial load in chunked blocking mode.

We've enhanced the reliability of our Change Data Capture (CDC) components, specifically when using the `chunked_blocking` mode for initial data loads. Previously, an issue could cause the component to incorrectly trigger a full re-snapshot of source tables *after* the initial chunked snapshot was already completed.

This release fixes that behavior. Now, CDC components using `chunked_blocking` mode will seamlessly transition from the initial snapshot phase directly into streaming ongoing changes. This prevents unnecessary load on your source systems and ensures a smoother, more predictable data replication process from the start.

Alongside this key fix, we've added the ability for PostgreSQL CDC connectors to fetch server version and timezone details. Other minor improvements include code cleanup and adjusted configuration logging for better clarity.



## Changes:



- fix snapshotting in chunked_blocking mode 




- include common folders in docker compose dev service 




- cleanup (remove commented out lines) 




- add missing abstract methods overrides for PostgreSQL & update tests 




- don't scare users by warnings for empty advanced parameters üëª 




- abstract method's typing matches implementation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- cleanup üßπ 




- MySQL 0.14.2 / PostgreSQL 0.17.2
