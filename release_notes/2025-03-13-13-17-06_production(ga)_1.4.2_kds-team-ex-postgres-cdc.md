**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: CDC Update: Chunked Blocking Snapshot Fixed

Excerpt: Corrected snapshot behavior in CDC chunked blocking mode and added PostgreSQL-specific setup validation.

Post detail:
We've addressed an issue within the Change Data Capture (CDC) component specifically affecting the `chunked_blocking` mode. Previously, the component could incorrectly trigger a new full snapshot cycle immediately after completing the initial one. This update corrects the signaling logic, ensuring that once the initial table snapshots are finished, the component proceeds correctly to incremental streaming or waits as intended, preventing unnecessary and potentially disruptive re-snapshotting. This improves the stability and efficiency of the initial data capture process.

Additionally, this release introduces enhancements for PostgreSQL users. We've added specific implementations for database version checks, replication slot validation, and privilege checks, improving the robustness of the setup process for PostgreSQL backends before data streaming begins. Other updates include adjustments to configuration handling to avoid warnings for intentionally empty advanced parameters and internal code improvements like type hint consistency and removal of unused code, enhancing maintainability.



## Changes:



- fix snapshotting in chunked_blocking mode 




- include common folders in docker compose dev service 




- cleanup (remove commented out lines) 




- add missing abstract methods overrides for PostgreSQL & update tests 




- don't scare users by warnings for empty advanced parameters üëª 




- abstract method's typing matches implementation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- cleanup üßπ 




- MySQL 0.14.2 / PostgreSQL 0.17.2
