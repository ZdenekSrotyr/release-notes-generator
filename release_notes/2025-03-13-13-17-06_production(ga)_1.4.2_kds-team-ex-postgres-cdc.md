## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Component Stability Enhancements
Key fixes enhance the reliability of CDC component operations, particularly concerning snapshotting logic and PostgreSQL sources.

We've rolled out updates focused on enhancing the stability and reliability of our Change Data Capture (CDC) components.

This release corrects specific behaviors to ensure smoother data replication. Firstly, we've addressed an issue where, under certain snapshotting conditions (`chunked_blocking` mode), components could incorrectly trigger a full table re-snapshot immediately after the initial one completed. This fix ensures snapshotting operates predictably and efficiently, preventing unnecessary data reprocessing and resource usage.

Secondly, we have improved how our CDC components interact specifically with PostgreSQL databases. By implementing more precise handling for PostgreSQL, we ensure correct behavior and prevent potential errors when using it as a data source.

These enhancements contribute to a more robust and dependable CDC process within Keboola.



## Changes:



- fix snapshotting in chunked_blocking mode 




- include common folders in docker compose dev service 




- cleanup (remove commented out lines) 




- add missing abstract methods overrides for PostgreSQL & update tests 




- don't scare users by warnings for empty advanced parameters üëª 




- abstract method's typing matches implementation üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- cleanup üßπ 




- MySQL 0.14.2 / PostgreSQL 0.17.2
