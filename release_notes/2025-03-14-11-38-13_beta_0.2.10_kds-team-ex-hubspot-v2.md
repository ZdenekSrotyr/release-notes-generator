## Change log (AI generated):
## Consistent Column Order in Python Outputs
Python component outputs now maintain a stable column order based on how properties are defined or fetched.

We've refined the data processing logic within our Python components. We have removed an internal mechanism that could occasionally alter the sequence of columns in output tables.

This update ensures that the order of columns in your output data is now consistently determined by how properties are retrieved from the source or defined within the component configuration. You can expect a more stable and predictable output schema.

This enhancement simplifies the management of table structures and the development of reliable downstream processes that depend on a specific column order.
