## Change log (AI generated):
## HubSpot Extractor: Update to Column Order and Primary Key Handling
Updates to the HubSpot Extractor remove automatic column reordering and explicit primary key setting in table manifests.

We have updated the HubSpot Extractor, refining how output data is structured. These changes simplify the component's logic but may require attention for specific downstream processes.

Specifically, the logic that automatically moved the `hs_object_id` column to the first position has been removed. Consequently, the column order in your output CSV files might change if you previously relied on `hs_object_id` appearing first for certain objects.

Additionally, the component no longer automatically identifies specific columns (like `id`, `dealId`, `companyId`) as primary keys during table preparation. This means the `KBC.primaryKey` metadata will not be set in the output table manifest *by this specific mechanism*. If your downstream processes in Keboola Connection rely on this automatically set primary key for tasks like incremental loading or deduplication, please review your configurations to ensure they function as expected.

No other changes affecting the core data processing logic of the component have been made.
