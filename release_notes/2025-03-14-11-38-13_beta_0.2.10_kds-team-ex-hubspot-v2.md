## Change log (AI generated):
## HubSpot Writer: Update to `id` Column Positioning
The `id` column in HubSpot writer output tables will now maintain its relative position instead of being automatically moved first.

We have updated the HubSpot writer component regarding how output table columns are ordered. Previously, the writer included logic that automatically moved the `id` column to the first position, regardless of its position in the input data.

This automatic reordering logic has now been removed. As a result, the `id` column will no longer be forced to the beginning of your output tables. Its position will now directly reflect the order defined by the source data or any preceding processing steps within your Keboola flows.

This change provides more predictable and consistent column ordering in your HubSpot writer outputs, aligning better with the structure of your input data.
