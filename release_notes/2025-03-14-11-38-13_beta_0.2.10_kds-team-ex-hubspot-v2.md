## Change log (AI generated):
## Python Processing: Column Order Stabilized
Python data processing outputs now feature more predictable column order.

We have refined our main Python data processing logic by removing an internal column swap operation.

This change ensures that the order of columns in your output data more consistently reflects the order received from the source or as defined in your extraction configuration. It eliminates a step that could potentially lead to unexpected column reordering during processing, leading to more predictable outcomes.
