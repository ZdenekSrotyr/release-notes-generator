## New Extractor: Apple App Store Connect Sales Reports
Automate the extraction and loading of your sales reports from Apple App Store Connect directly into Keboola Storage.

We are excited to introduce the new Apple App Store Connect Sales Reports extractor, designed to streamline the process of getting your vital sales data into Keboola.

This component securely connects to the Apple App Store Connect API using your provided credentials (Key ID, Issuer ID, Private Key via JWT authentication). You can configure it to fetch the specific reports you require, selecting vendors, frequencies, report types, subtypes, and versions according to your needs.

The extractor automatically handles the complexities of interacting with the API, including managing pagination for large reports and decompressing the Gzip-compressed files provided by Apple. It processes the raw report data and prepares it as standard CSV tables within your Keboola Storage, creating the necessary manifest files for easy loading. Basic logging and error handling are included to ensure smooth operation within your projects.

Integrate your Apple App Store sales performance data into your Keboola workflows effortlessly and unlock deeper insights faster.
