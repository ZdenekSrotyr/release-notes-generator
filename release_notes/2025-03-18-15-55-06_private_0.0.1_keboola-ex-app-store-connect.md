## Change log (AI generated):
## New Extractor: Apple App Store Connect Finance Reports
Introducing a new extractor to retrieve finance reports directly from the Apple App Store Connect API into Keboola Storage.

We have launched a new extractor designed to fetch finance reports from the Apple App Store Connect API. This component connects directly to the `v1/financeReports` endpoint using secure JWT authentication, configurable with your Key ID, Issuer ID, and Private Key.

You can specify the desired reports through configuration parameters, including `reportType`, `frequency`, `vendorNumber`, and filters like `reportDate`. The extractor automatically handles API pagination to retrieve all available data pages, ensuring complete report extraction.

Fetched reports, initially provided in a gzipped format by the API, are downloaded, decompressed, and saved as CSV files directly into your Keboola Storage output tables, complete with manifests, making the data readily available for your workflows.
