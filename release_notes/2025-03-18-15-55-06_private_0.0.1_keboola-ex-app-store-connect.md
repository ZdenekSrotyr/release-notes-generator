## Change log (AI generated):
Title: App Store Connect: Analytics Reports Now Available
Excerpt: Extract detailed analytics reports directly from Apple App Store Connect into Keboola Storage.
Post Detail:
Introducing the capability to extract analytics reports using the App Store Connect component.

Configure multiple distinct reports within a single component setup. For each report, specify the required dimensions, metrics, frequency (e.g., DAILY, WEEKLY), date range, and an optional grouping dimension.

The component automatically fetches data from the App Store Connect `/v1/analyticsReports` API endpoint, handling pagination to ensure complete data retrieval based on your settings. Each configured report's data is loaded into a separate output table in Keboola Storage, facilitating downstream analysis and processing. The underlying API client manages secure authentication and interaction with the App Store Connect API.
