## Change log (AI generated):
## New App Store Connect Extractor Available
Easily extract your sales, financial, and analytics reports from the App Store Connect API directly into Keboola.

We are excited to announce the release of our new App Store Connect Extractor component. This component allows you to automatically fetch crucial data about your app's performance directly from the Apple App Store Connect API and load it into your Keboola Storage.

Configure the extractor with your API credentials, specify the Vendor ID, and select the reports you need (including type, frequency, subtypes, and versions). The component handles the connection, authentication, and data fetching process, retrieving reports based on your defined schedule and date ranges (e.g., daily, weekly).

Key features include incremental processing, which ensures only new data is fetched after the initial run, saving time and resources. The extractor automatically structures the data into predefined output tables and generates the necessary manifest files for seamless, incremental loading into Keboola Storage. Start leveraging your App Store Connect data within Keboola today!
