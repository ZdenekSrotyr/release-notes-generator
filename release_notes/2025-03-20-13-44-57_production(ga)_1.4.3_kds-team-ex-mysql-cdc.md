#  kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc 1.4.3

_Released on 2025-03-20_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.3](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.3)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## Default Snapshot Mode Changed to `chunked_blocking`
The default initial snapshot strategy is now `chunked_blocking`, affecting configurations where `snapshot_mode` is not explicitly set.

The default value for the `snapshot_mode` configuration parameter has been updated. If the parameter is not explicitly defined in your configuration, the component will now use `chunked_blocking` instead of the previous default, `initial`, for performing the initial data snapshot. This change affects how the initial data load is executed, potentially altering locking behavior and data consistency during the snapshot process for configurations relying on the default setting.

Additionally, this update includes newer versions of the underlying database extractor libraries: `keboola.db-extractor-mysql` (v0.14.3) and `keboola.db-extractor-postgres` (v0.17.3). These updates may contain bug fixes or minor adjustments from the libraries themselves. Furthermore, the `changes_only` option has been removed from the allowed values for the `snapshot_mode` parameter, preventing its use in configurations.



## Changes:



- chunked_blocking is the new default snapshot_mode + temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI 




- MySQL 0.14.3 / PostgreSQL 0.17.3
