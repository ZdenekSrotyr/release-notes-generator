## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Component Update: Improved Snapshot Handling & Library Upgrades
Updates to CDC components change the default snapshot behavior for improved stability and enforce initial snapshots, alongside underlying library upgrades.

We've updated our Change Data Capture (CDC) components to enhance stability and streamline the initial data synchronization process.

The default method for performing initial snapshots (`snapshot_mode`) has been changed from `initial_only` to `chunked_blocking`. If you haven't explicitly set this parameter, the component will now process the initial snapshot in smaller, locked chunks. This approach can reduce load on your source database compared to a single large transaction, although table locking is still involved during the chunk processing.

Additionally, the `changes_only` option for `snapshot_mode` has been removed. This change ensures that an initial snapshot is always performed when setting up CDC with this component version, guaranteeing a consistent starting point for tracking subsequent data changes.

These components now also utilize updated versions of the underlying `keboola-cdc-mysql` (to 0.14.3) and `keboola-cdc-postgres` (to 0.17.3) libraries. This brings potential bug fixes and performance improvements inherited from these core libraries, specific to each database type.



## Changes:



- chunked_blocking is the new default snapshot_mode + temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI 




- MySQL 0.14.3 / PostgreSQL 0.17.3
