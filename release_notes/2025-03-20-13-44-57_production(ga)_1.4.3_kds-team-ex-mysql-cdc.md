**Component:** [kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)

**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** CDC Component: Default Snapshot Mode Changed

**Excerpt:** CDC components now default to `chunked_blocking` for initial snapshots, replacing `initial_only`.

**Post detail:**
The default behavior for initial data snapshots in CDC components has been updated. The `snapshot_mode` parameter now defaults to `chunked_blocking` instead of the previous `initial_only`. If no specific mode is configured, the component will use the `chunked_blocking` method for the initial data capture, processing the snapshot in chunks.

Additionally, the `changes_only` option has been removed as a valid selection for the `snapshot_mode` parameter. Configurations attempting to use this mode, which previously skipped the initial snapshot, will no longer be valid.

Underlying library dependencies for MySQL (`keboola.cdc-connector-mysql` to `^0.14.3`) and PostgreSQL (`keboola.cdc-connector-postgres` to `^0.17.3`) have also been updated, incorporating fixes and changes from these newer connector versions.



## Changes:



- chunked_blocking is the new default snapshot_mode + temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI 




- MySQL 0.14.3 / PostgreSQL 0.17.3
