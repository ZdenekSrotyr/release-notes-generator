#  kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc 1.4.3

_Released on 2025-03-20_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.3](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.3)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Component Default Snapshot Mode Updated

The default initial synchronization mode for the Python CDC component has been updated to `chunked_blocking` for enhanced reliability.

We've updated the default behavior for the `snapshot_mode` parameter within our Python CDC component execution logic. Previously defaulting to `changes_only`, it now defaults to `chunked_blocking`.

This change primarily affects component configurations where the `snapshot_mode` is not explicitly defined. In such cases, the component will now perform a full, chunked, blocking snapshot of the source table(s) upon its initial run, ensuring all existing data is captured before switching to tracking subsequent changes. The previous default (`changes_only`) would only capture changes occurring after the component was started, potentially missing the initial data state.

This new default provides a more robust and complete initial data synchronization out-of-the-box. If you require the previous behavior of only capturing changes from the start, you can explicitly set the `snapshot_mode` parameter to `changes_only` in your component configuration.

## CDC Component Dependency Updates for MySQL & PostgreSQL

We've updated the underlying libraries for MySQL and PostgreSQL CDC sources to incorporate the latest improvements.

The Python CDC component now utilizes newer versions of the database-specific CDC libraries: `keboola.db.cdc.mysql` has been updated to version `0.14.3` and `keboola.db.cdc.postgres` to version `0.17.3`.

These updates incorporate potential bug fixes and minor enhancements from the respective library maintainers. While typically resulting in subtle improvements, this ensures the component benefits from the latest stability and performance adjustments specific to MySQL and PostgreSQL change data capture processes. No action is required, as these updated libraries are now automatically used by the component.



## Changes:



- chunked_blocking is the new default snapshot_mode + temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI 




- MySQL 0.14.3 / PostgreSQL 0.17.3
