**Component:** [kds-team.ex-mysql-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.3](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.3)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
Refined CDC Snapshot Handling & Library Updates
Key updates to CDC component snapshot modes and underlying connector libraries enhance initial load behavior.

We've updated the Change Data Capture (CDC) component with adjustments to snapshot behavior and underlying libraries.

The default method for initial data snapshots (`snapshot_mode`) has been changed to `chunked_blocking`. This strategy processes tables in chunks, potentially holding database locks for shorter durations compared to the previous default (`initial_only`), impacting performance during the initial data load. Additionally, the `changes_only` snapshot mode has been removed. Configurations can no longer skip the initial snapshot; one of the available modes (`initial_only`, `when_needed`, `never`, `chunked_blocking`) must now be used to perform an initial data load before processing changes.

Furthermore, the component now utilizes updated versions of the underlying MySQL and PostgreSQL CDC connector libraries. These updates may include bug fixes or minor behavioral adjustments inherent to the newer library versions, potentially affecting data processing.



## Changes:



- chunked_blocking is the new default snapshot_mode + temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI 




- MySQL 0.14.3 / PostgreSQL 0.17.3
