## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Component Update: New Default Snapshot Mode

CDC components now use `chunked_blocking` as the default snapshot mode, replacing the removed `changes_only` option for initial data capture.

We have updated the default behavior for the initial data synchronization phase (snapshotting) in our Change Data Capture (CDC) components. The `snapshot_mode` parameter now defaults to `chunked_blocking` instead of the previous `changes_only`. This means that by default, the initial snapshot will read source tables in chunks while applying locks, offering a different approach compared to relying solely on the database's change stream from the start.

Additionally, the `changes_only` option has been removed from the available configuration choices for `snapshot_mode`. Users configuring the component must now select from the remaining modes: `chunked_blocking`, `initial_only`, or `when_needed`. This change standardizes the available initial snapshotting strategies.

Minor updates also include increments to the required versions of the underlying MySQL CDC (`0.14.3`) and PostgreSQL CDC (`0.17.3`) libraries, potentially bringing refinements to change data event processing.



## Changes:



- chunked_blocking is the new default snapshot_mode + temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI 




- MySQL 0.14.3 / PostgreSQL 0.17.3
