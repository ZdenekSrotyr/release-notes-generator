#  kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc 1.4.3

_Released on 2025-03-20_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.3](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.3)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Python CDC Component: Updated Initial Snapshot Behavior

**Excerpt:** Python CDC component now defaults to `chunked_blocking` for initial snapshots and includes updated database CDC libraries.

**Post Detail:**
The default method for performing initial data snapshots in the Python CDC component has changed. If the `snapshot_mode` parameter is not explicitly specified in your component configuration, the system will now use the `chunked_blocking` method instead of the previous default, `initial_only`.

This change alters the underlying mechanism used to capture the initial state of your tables, potentially affecting performance and database load during the snapshot phase. While the method has changed, the goal remains to capture the same point-in-time data snapshot.

Additionally, the component's dependencies on the underlying `keboola.db.cdc.mysql` (now version 0.14.3) and `keboola.db.cdc.postgres` (now version 0.17.3) libraries have been updated. This incorporates the latest changes, including potential bug fixes or behavioral adjustments, from these specific database CDC libraries, which could indirectly influence the data capture process.



## Changes:



- chunked_blocking is the new default snapshot_mode + temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI 




- MySQL 0.14.3 / PostgreSQL 0.17.3
