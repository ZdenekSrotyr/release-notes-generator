#  kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc 1.4.3

_Released on 2025-03-20_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.3](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.3)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## Snapshot Mode Update: 'chunked_blocking' is the New Default
Default snapshot mode updated to 'chunked_blocking'; 'changes_only' option removed.

We have updated the initial data synchronization behavior for components utilizing snapshotting. The default value for the snapshot_mode parameter has been changed from changes_only to chunked_blocking.

This means that if snapshot_mode is not explicitly configured for a component, it will now use the chunked_blocking method by default. This method performs the initial snapshot by processing data in chunks while temporarily locking tables, ensuring a complete initial data load. Previously, the default changes_only mode primarily focused on the change stream after schema capture, potentially skipping a full initial data transfer.

Furthermore, the changes_only option has been completely removed from the available snapshot_mode settings. You will no longer be able to select this mode for new configurations. Existing component configurations explicitly set to changes_only may require updating to a supported mode like chunked_blocking or when_needed to ensure continued functionality and successful validation. These adjustments aim to enhance the reliability and consistency of initial data loads.



## Changes:



- chunked_blocking is the new default snapshot_mode + temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI 




- MySQL 0.14.3 / PostgreSQL 0.17.3
