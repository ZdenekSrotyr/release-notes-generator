## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Snapshot Mode Updates: Improved Default & Streamlined Options
We've updated the default initial snapshot mode for new CDC configurations to `chunked_blocking` and removed the `changes_only` option for improved setup and reliability.

We've made some important updates to the snapshot mode settings within our Change Data Capture (CDC) components to enhance default behavior and streamline configuration options.

Firstly, the default `snapshot_mode` for all *new* CDC component configurations has been changed from `initial` to `chunked_blocking`. This new default generally offers a more robust approach for the initial data load, potentially improving performance and managing database locking more effectively during the snapshot phase compared to the previous default. Existing configurations retain their current settings unless manually updated.

Secondly, the `changes_only` snapshot mode option has been removed and is no longer supported. Attempting to configure or use this mode will now result in a validation error. This change ensures that CDC setups follow standard practices, which typically require an initial data snapshot before processing ongoing changes captured via the transaction log.



## Changes:



- chunked_blocking is the new default snapshot_mode + temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI 




- MySQL 0.14.3 / PostgreSQL 0.17.3
