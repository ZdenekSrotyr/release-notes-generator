_Released on 2025-03-20_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-postgres-cdc](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component)  
**Tag:** [1.4.3](https://github.com/keboola/python-cdc-component/releases/tag/1.4.3)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
# Title
Default Initial Load Behavior Changed to Full Data Snapshot

# Excerpt
Components relying on default settings will now perform a full data snapshot (`chunked_blocking`) instead of schema-only during the initial load.

# Post Detail
We have updated the default behavior for the initial data load process in certain components.

The default value for the `SNAPSHOT_MODE` configuration parameter has been changed from `schema_only` to `chunked_blocking`.

This means that if the `snapshot_mode` is not explicitly specified in your component configuration, the initial run will now perform a full data snapshot using the `chunked_blocking` method. Previously, the default behavior was to only retrieve the schema (`schema_only`). This change affects how the initial full load of data is extracted from the source when using default component settings.



## Changes:



- chunked_blocking is the new default snapshot_mode + temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI 




- MySQL 0.14.3 / PostgreSQL 0.17.3
