## Change log (AI generated):
## Foundation Laid for New Google Play Console Component
The initial code structure for a new Google Play Console component has been added to the platform.

We have added the foundational code structure for a potential new component designed to interact with the Google Play Console. This includes the creation of standard Python files (`main.py`, `component.py`, `config.py`), establishing the basic framework required for its execution within the Keboola platform.

Currently, these files contain placeholder logic and serve only as the initial scaffolding. This update does not yet introduce any data processing capabilities or fetch data from the Google Play Console. There is no impact on your existing data or workflows from this preparatory step.

This development marks the first structural step towards building this new integration. Keep an eye on future changelog posts for updates as we build out the component's features and functionalities.
