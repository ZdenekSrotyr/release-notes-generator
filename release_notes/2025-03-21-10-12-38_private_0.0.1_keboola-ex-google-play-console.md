## Unlock Google Play Console Reports Directly in Keboola
Fetch key Google Play Console reports (Installs, Ratings, Crashes, Reviews) directly into your Keboola projects.

We are excited to introduce the new Google Play Console extractor, enabling you to easily integrate crucial app performance data into your Keboola environment.

This extractor connects directly to the Google Cloud Storage buckets where your Play Console reports are exported. You can now automatically fetch key reports such as Installs, Ratings, Crashes & ANRs, and Reviews for your specified application package name.

Configuration is straightforward: provide your Google Service Account credentials for authentication, specify your application's package name, and select the reports you need. The extractor handles downloading the raw CSV files from GCS and transforms them into structured, ready-to-use tables within your Keboola Connection Storage.

Gain deeper insights by analyzing your app's performance alongside your other business data directly within Keboola.
