## Change log (AI generated):
## New Extractor: Google Play Console Reporting
Introducing a new component to extract reporting data from the Google Play Console API into Keboola.

We have released a new extractor component designed to retrieve data from the Google Play Developer Reporting API.

This component orchestrates the entire data extraction process. It begins by reading and validating the user-provided configuration (`config.json`), which specifies report types, dimensions, metrics, date ranges, and credentials. Based on this validated configuration, it authenticates with the Google API, constructs the necessary requests, and fetches the report data directly from the Google Play Console.

Finally, the extractor handles the storage of the retrieved data within Keboola Connection. It creates output CSV files, defines the structure for the destination tables (including setting primary keys based on the dimensions specified in the configuration), and writes the data accordingly.
