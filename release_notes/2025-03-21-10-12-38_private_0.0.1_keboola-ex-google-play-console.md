## Change log (AI generated):
## Google Play Extractor: Configuration Structure Implemented
Configure Google Play reports: the extractor now reads settings but continues to output placeholder data.

The Google Play extractor component has been updated to read configuration parameters provided by the user. It now processes the specified Google Play service account credentials, the target application package name, and the list of reports to be generated, including their dimensions, metrics, and filters.

A structure has been implemented to iterate through the configured reports, laying the groundwork for handling multiple report definitions within a single component run. While the component reads and prepares to loop through these report definitions based on your settings, the actual fetching and processing of data from the Google Play Console API is not yet implemented in this version.

Consequently, the component currently continues to output a static placeholder CSV file (sample.csv) instead of actual report data. Additional updates include adding necessary libraries (keboola.component, requests) and a configuration schema (config.json) to validate user input and define the component's interface. Source code files have also been reorganized within the project structure.
