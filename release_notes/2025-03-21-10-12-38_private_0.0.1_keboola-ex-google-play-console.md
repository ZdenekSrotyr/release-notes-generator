## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Automate Google Play Console Reporting

Excerpt: Introducing a new extractor component to automatically fetch Google Play Console reports from Google Cloud Storage into Keboola Storage.

Post detail:
We are releasing the initial version of a new extractor designed to streamline the process of getting your Google Play Console data into Keboola. This component focuses on retrieving performance and statistics reports directly from Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

The extractor reads your specified configuration, including GCS credentials and the list of desired reports. It then connects to the designated GCS buckets, downloads the relevant CSV report files, and writes the data into corresponding output tables within your Keboola Storage.

Functionality for creating table manifests is included, allowing you to define primary keys and manage incremental loading for your output tables. This establishes the foundational mechanism for automated data extraction and loading of Google Play Console reports.
