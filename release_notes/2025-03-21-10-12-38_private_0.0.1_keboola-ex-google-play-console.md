## Unlock Google Play Console Insights with Our New GCS Extractor
Easily extract your Google Play Console performance reports directly from Google Cloud Storage into Keboola Storage.

We are excited to introduce a new component designed to streamline the process of getting valuable Google Play Console data into your Keboola projects. This extractor connects directly to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), where Google Play Console delivers its bulk performance reports.

Configure the component with your GCS credentials, specify the target application package name, and select the reports, date ranges, dimensions, and metrics you need. The extractor handles fetching the relevant report files from GCS, processing the data (typically CSV files), and loading it into predefined, structured tables within your Keboola Storage.

This provides an automated pipeline for integrating key app performance indicators like installs, ratings, crashes, and financial data from Google Play directly into your Keboola environment, ready for analysis and integration with your other data sources.
