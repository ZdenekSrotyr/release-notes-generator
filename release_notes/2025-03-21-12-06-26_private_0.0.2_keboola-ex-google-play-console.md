## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Component Troubleshooting with Debug Logging
We've added detailed debug logging capabilities to improve component observability and make troubleshooting easier.

This update introduces extensive debug logging throughout the component's code. While the core data processing logic remains unchanged, these new logs provide much deeper visibility into the component's execution steps.

You can now see detailed information about configuration, parameters used, API interactions, and status messages during a run. This enhanced observability is invaluable for diagnosing issues or understanding component behavior in complex scenarios.

The level of detail is controllable via new environment variables (`KBC_DEBUG`, `KBC_DEBUG_LEVEL`), allowing you to enable verbose logging specifically when needed for troubleshooting, without impacting standard runs. This improvement aims to streamline the debugging process and provide clearer insights when you need them most.
