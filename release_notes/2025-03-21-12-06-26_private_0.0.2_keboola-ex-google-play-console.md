## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Debug Logging for Components
Gain deeper insights into component execution with newly added debug logging.

We have implemented additional debug logging statements within key component files (`src/component/component.py`, `src/component/downloader.py`). These logs are designed to provide a more detailed trace of the execution flow and variable states during runtime.

This enhancement does not change the core data processing logic (fetching, transformation, writing) or affect the final output data. The detailed logging information will only be present when the debug log level is explicitly enabled, offering improved troubleshooting capabilities for developers and support teams when needed.
