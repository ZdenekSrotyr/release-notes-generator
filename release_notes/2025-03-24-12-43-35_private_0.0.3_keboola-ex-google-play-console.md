## Change log (AI generated):
Internal Code Quality Updates
Internal code improvements enhance maintainability with no change to functionality.

This update focuses on internal code quality enhancements within the component. We have introduced type hints to function signatures and variables, primarily in `src/component.py` and `src/main.py`, to improve clarity.

Additionally, minor adjustments were made to logging levels under specific error conditions (changing from info to debug) and subtle refinements were applied to error message formatting during parameter validation. These changes, along with general code formatting updates, contribute to better code readability and future maintainability without altering the component's core data processing logic or output.
