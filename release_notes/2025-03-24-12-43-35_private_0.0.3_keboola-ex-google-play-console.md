## Refined Google Play Extractor: Predictable Output & Robust Processing
The Google Play extractor has been updated with explicit schema definitions and improved data processing for more reliable and predictable outputs.

We've rolled out several enhancements to the Google Play extractor aimed at increasing its reliability, predictability, and ease of configuration. These changes improve how data is processed and how output tables are structured.

A key update is the introduction of explicit definitions for output table columns and primary keys for each report type, located in a new `table_definitions.py` file. Previously, this was handled dynamically. This change provides clearer control over the output schema. Please note: This may alter the structure (column names, order, or primary keys) of your existing output tables, so we recommend reviewing any downstream dependencies.

Data processing logic has also been significantly refactored. The extractor now more robustly handles various dimension and metric types (like `day`, `device`, `country`, `decimalValue`, `int64Value`) received from the Google Play API by explicitly mapping them based on field names in the API response. This ensures more accurate transformation of raw API data into structured table rows.

Additionally, configuration has been standardized using structured models (Pydantic), simplifying report definitions (dimensions, metrics, timelines). Input validation has also been added to prevent runs with invalid date ranges (e.g., end date before start date). While much of the refactoring improves internal code structure, these specific changes directly enhance the component's stability and the consistency of the data you receive.
