## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Update: Enhanced Google API Error Handling
We've enhanced error handling for Google API interactions, improving component robustness and reporting.

Specific exception handling for Google API errors, including `google.auth.exceptions.RefreshError` and `googleapiclient.errors.HttpError`, has been implemented within the component.

This improved handling covers the main execution flow (`src/component.py`), the discovery of available reports from Google Cloud Storage, and the downloading of report files (`src/google_api.py`). These changes enhance error reporting clarity and overall component resilience when encountering Google authentication problems or other API issues.

The core data processing logic during successful component runs remains unchanged.
