## Component Update: Corrected Output Table Handling

This update corrects the output data path, ensuring results are reliably saved to Keboola Storage tables.

We have released an update that addresses how output data is handled by the component. Previously, processed data might not have been correctly recognized as standard output tables due to an incorrect path configuration.

This version corrects the output destination to `/data/out/tables/`, ensuring that all results generated by the component are properly saved and made available as output tables in your Keboola Storage. This allows for seamless integration with subsequent processing steps in your flows.

Additionally, we have incorporated more detailed logging throughout the component's execution. This enhancement provides greater visibility into the component's operations via the job logs, simplifying monitoring and troubleshooting if necessary.
