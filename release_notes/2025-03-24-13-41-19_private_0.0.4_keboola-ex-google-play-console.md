Title: Component Internal Enhancements

Excerpt: This update focuses on improving component observability and code consistency behind the scenes.

Post Detail:
We've implemented enhancements within the component's internal structure. Although these changes do not alter the core data processing logic or the results you see, they improve the component's maintainability and operational transparency.

Specifically, we have added more detailed logging statements throughout the code. This will help our team and potentially advanced users trace execution steps and diagnose issues more effectively during component runs. Additionally, we have refactored how input and output file paths are constructed internally, standardizing them for better code consistency and reliability. These updates ensure smoother operation and easier troubleshooting without affecting data outcomes.
