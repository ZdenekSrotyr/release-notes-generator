## Change log (AI generated):
## Python Component Update: Standardized Data Paths & Enhanced Stability
This update standardizes data directory handling based on the KBC_DATADIR environment variable and introduces improvements for component stability and monitoring.

The Python component's method for determining the data directory has been updated. It now explicitly uses the KBC_DATADIR environment variable to locate input and output files. If this variable is not set, the component defaults to using the `/data/` directory. This change ensures consistent behavior and standardizes how the component interacts with the Keboola environment's file system, potentially affecting where your component reads configuration or writes tables if you relied on previous implicit behavior.

Alongside this, several enhancements have been added to improve stability and observability. We've integrated logging throughout the execution process to provide better visibility into component operations and aid in debugging. Configuration parameters are now validated earlier to catch potential issues before processing begins. Additionally, improved exception handling ensures the component manages runtime errors more gracefully, logging issues instead of potentially crashing abruptly.
