## Change log (AI generated):
## Cleaner Output Filenames & Enhanced Logging
Output CSV filenames are now standardized by replacing special characters, alongside improved runtime logging for better visibility.

We've implemented a couple of updates aimed at improving consistency and operational transparency.

Firstly, the naming convention for output CSV files has been refined. Filenames are now generated by taking the `data_type` configuration parameter and replacing any non-alphanumeric characters (including '/') with underscores, before appending `.csv`. This results in cleaner, more predictable filenames stored in your project, without affecting the actual data content or structure within the files.

Secondly, we've added more detailed logging statements during component execution. This enhancement provides better visibility into the component's runtime behavior, aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting, but does not alter the data processing logic or output.



## Changes:



- fix UI, fix path, added logging
