## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Addition of Logger Configuration and Logger Files

Excerpt: Changes in logging configuration may affect debugging and error tracking.

Post Detail: 

In this release, two significant changes were made to the 'component_config' directory. A new file named 'loggerConfiguration.json' was added which may alter the way logging is handled in the component. Changes in this file can affect the component's information logging, potentially impacting debugging and error tracking. 

Similarly, another file named 'logger' was also added to the 'component_config' directory. Changes to this file could also influence how the component logs information, affecting debugging and error tracking processes. 

The Dockerfile received an update aimed at enhancing build times, which may reduce the time taken to deploy the component. 

A new feature was introduced that enables the component to continue processing despite encountering errors, potentially leading to more robust data processing. 

Lastly, a change was made to the component's log level, potentially affecting the verbosity of the logs and impacting debugging and error tracking. 

Please note that the specific files where the 'Continue on Error' feature and 'Change in Log Level' were implemented have not been specified.
