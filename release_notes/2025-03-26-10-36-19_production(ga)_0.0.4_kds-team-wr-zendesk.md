## Enhanced Component Resilience: Introducing Continue on Error
Handle individual job errors without halting your entire component run using the new 'Continue on Error' option.

We're excited to introduce a new capability designed to improve the robustness of your component runs: "Continue on Error".

Previously, if a component encountered an error while processing an individual job (like writing a specific record or batch), the entire component run would stop. With the new `CONTINUE_ON_ERROR` parameter, you now have more control. By setting this parameter to `True`, the component will log the specific job error as a warning and continue processing any subsequent jobs within the run. The default behavior remains `False`, where the first processing error halts the component.

This enhancement allows components to process more data successfully, especially in scenarios where only a subset of jobs might fail due to transient issues or data-specific problems. Instead of a complete stoppage, you get partial success and clear warnings in your logs indicating which specific jobs encountered issues, enabling more resilient data processing pipelines.
