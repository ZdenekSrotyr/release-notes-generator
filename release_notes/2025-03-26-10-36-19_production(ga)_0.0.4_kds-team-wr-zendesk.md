**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
**Post 1: Continue on Error Feature**

Title: New 'Continue on Error' Option for Robust Processing
Excerpt: Optional parameter allows components to continue processing remaining inputs after encountering an error with a specific file or table.
Post Detail:
We have introduced a new optional parameter, `continue_on_error`, to enhance component resilience. By default, this parameter is set to `False`, maintaining the existing behavior where any exception during the processing of an input file or table halts the entire component run.

Setting `continue_on_error` to `True` changes this behavior. If an error occurs while processing a specific input file or table, the component will now log a warning, skip that problematic input, and proceed to process the next available inputs. This allows the component to complete its run and process all valid data, even if encountering issues with a subset of the input, preventing a single failure from blocking the entire operation.

**Post 2: Changed Skipped File Log Level**

Title: Adjusted Log Level for Skipped Files
Excerpt: When 'Continue on Error' is enabled, errors processing individual files are now logged as Warnings instead of Errors.
Post Detail:
As part of the introduction of the 'Continue on Error' feature, we've adjusted the logging behavior for skipped inputs.

When the `continue_on_error` parameter is set to `True` and the component encounters an error processing a specific input file or table, the corresponding log message indicating the issue and the skipping of that input will now be recorded with a `WARNING` severity level. Previously, such events might have been logged as `ERROR`. This change only affects the severity level reported in the run logs under this specific condition and does not alter the component's execution logic or which data is processed or skipped.
