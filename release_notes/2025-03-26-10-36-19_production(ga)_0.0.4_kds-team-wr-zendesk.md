## Keep Your Jobs Running: Improved Error Handling
Enhanced error handling allows jobs to complete successfully by logging individual record errors and continuing with the rest.

We've improved how our components handle errors during data processing. Previously, encountering an issue while writing a single record could cause the entire job to fail, stopping all further progress.

With this update, components are more resilient. If an error occurs with an individual record during the write operation, the component will now log the specific error and continue processing the remaining valid records. This means your job can finish successfully even if some records couldn't be processed.

This change significantly increases the reliability of your data pipelines. While the output data might be incomplete if record-specific errors are encountered, the overall job can complete, ensuring that all salvageable data is processed. Details about any skipped records and the reasons why can be found within the job's event logs.

Additionally, we have made minor adjustments to the logging level configuration, which might change the amount of detail you see in the logs. This does not affect data processing itself.
