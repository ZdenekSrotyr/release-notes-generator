#  kds-team.wr-zendesk 0.0.4

_Released on 2025-03-26_

**Component:** [kds-team.wr-zendesk](https://github.com/keboola/component-zendesk-wr)  
**Tag:** [0.0.4](https://github.com/keboola/component-zendesk-wr/releases/tag/0.0.4)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Handling: Introducing "Continue on Error"
Components can now optionally continue processing jobs even after encountering an API error during result checking, allowing for partial success.

A new `continue_on_error` parameter has been added to component configuration. When enabled, if an HTTP error occurs while checking the results of an individual API job (e.g., writing one batch of data), the component will log the error and proceed to check the status of subsequent jobs. Previously, any such error would cause the entire component run to fail immediately.

This functionality, implemented within the `run` method's job processing loop in `src/component.py`, provides greater resilience by allowing components to complete processing for successful jobs even if others fail. Be aware that enabling this feature may result in incomplete data being written if errors are encountered during the run.

## Default Logging Level Adjusted to INFO
The default logging level for components has been updated from DEBUG to INFO to reduce standard log verbosity.

This change affects the default setting in `src/component.py`. Component runs will now generate less detailed logs unless the logging level is explicitly overridden in the configuration. This adjustment impacts only the volume of log messages produced and does not alter component execution logic or data processing.
