## Change log (AI generated):
## Keep Processing with Conditional Error Handling
Introducing a new option to allow components to continue processing data even when encountering errors on specific rows.

We've enhanced component robustness by introducing conditional error handling for row processing.

A new parameter, `continue_on_error`, is now available (defaulting to `False`). When set to `False`, components maintain their existing behavior, halting execution upon encountering the first error during row processing.

However, if you set `continue_on_error` to `True`, the component will now log the error as a warning and proceed to the next row. This allows the component to process as much valid data as possible, even if some input rows cause issues.

Be mindful that enabling this option might result in partially processed datasets if errors occur. Correspondingly, when this feature is active, errors related to skipped rows are now logged as warnings rather than exceptions to better reflect the continuation of the process. This update offers greater flexibility in handling imperfect data within your workflows.
