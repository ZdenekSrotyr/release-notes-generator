## App Store Connect Component Update: Enhanced Flexibility

We've updated the App Store Connect component for more robust configuration handling and smarter API requests.

This update introduces several improvements to the App Store Connect component, enhancing its flexibility and resilience.

Previously, if the `dimensions` or `metrics` keys were missing from your report configuration, the component would fail with an error. Now, the component automatically defaults to an empty list if these keys are not provided. This allows configurations to run successfully even without explicitly defined dimensions or metrics, though the output CSV structure will differ, omitting the corresponding columns.

Additionally, we've optimized how the component interacts with the App Store Connect API for sales reports. The `filter[dimension]` parameter is now only included in the API request if you have specified dimensions in your configuration. This makes the API calls more efficient and may result in differently aggregated data from the API if no dimensions are used, depending on the API's default behaviour.

Finally, a minor internal change modifies the report job identifier to include date parameters, improving how jobs are tracked within the component's processes.
