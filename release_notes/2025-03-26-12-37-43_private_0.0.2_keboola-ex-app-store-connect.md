## Change log (AI generated):
## More Resilient Data Processing: Missing 'segments' Handled
We've improved data processing component stability to prevent failures caused by missing 'segments' keys in API responses.

We've rolled out an update to improve the stability of data processing within certain components.
Previously, components might have failed if an incoming record from an API response was missing the expected 'segments' field. This could halt data processing unexpectedly.

With this enhancement, components now correctly handle records even if the 'segments' field is absent. The component will process these records without erroring, ensuring your data pipelines continue to run smoothly even with slight variations in source data structures.
This change leads to more resilient and reliable data processing, preventing failures caused by this specific missing data scenario.



## Changes:



- fix 






- handle missing segments
