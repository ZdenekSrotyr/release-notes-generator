App Store Connect Extractor: Incremental Loading & Stability Improvements

Enhanced App Store Connect extractor with date-based incremental fetching and improved error handling.

We've updated the App Store Connect extractor to support incremental loading. The component now utilizes `startDate` and `endDate` values found in the `incremental_config` (state file) to filter data directly via the App Store Connect API. This allows you to fetch only new or updated data since the last run, making your data pipelines more efficient by reducing the amount of data processed in each execution.

Additionally, this update significantly improves the extractor's resilience. It now gracefully handles missing optional configurations, such as the query name or the entire incremental configuration block, preventing failures caused by incomplete setup and defaulting to safer behaviors. The component is also more robust against unexpected API responses, correctly managing situations where expected 'data' or 'segments' keys might be missing in the response structure, ensuring smoother runs even with inconsistent source data.



## Changes:
