## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Update: Enhanced Error Tolerance
This update improves component stability by adding better handling for missing or malformed report data during processing.

This update enhances the component's resilience when encountering common data issues. It now includes improved error handling for several scenarios:
- If a report URL returns a 404 error during download, a warning is logged, and that specific report is skipped.
- If a line within a TSV report contains fewer columns than expected, a warning is logged, and the incomplete line is skipped.
- If an expected report file is not found during the processing stage (after download/extraction), a warning is logged, and processing continues with the next file.
These changes prevent the component from failing due to invalid URLs, malformed lines, or missing files, allowing it to complete execution more reliably. Note that data from skipped reports or lines will be excluded from the final output.

Additionally, the process for decompressing gzipped report files has been optimized. Decompression now happens directly from the response content in memory, rather than requiring a temporary disk file. This is primarily an internal implementation change modifying resource usage.
