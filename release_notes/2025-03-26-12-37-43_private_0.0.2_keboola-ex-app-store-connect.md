## Change log (AI generated):
## Fewer Failures: Components Now Handle Incomplete Data More Gracefully
Component updates improve stability by preventing errors when encountering empty reports or data points with missing information.

We've rolled out enhancements to improve the robustness and reliability of our data processing components, specifically addressing how they handle potentially incomplete or empty data returned by APIs.

Previously, if an API call for a specific report returned no data (either missing the `data` key or having an empty `data` field), the component could fail. Now, the component intelligently detects this scenario, logs a warning, skips processing for that specific empty report, and continues smoothly with the remaining reports. This ensures that legitimate empty reports don't halt your entire data flow.

Additionally, we've improved parsing logic to gracefully manage situations where individual data points within a report might be missing expected structure, such as the `segments` key. Instead of causing an error, the component will now log a warning, skip processing the dimensions and metrics for that specific incomplete data point, but continue processing all other valid data points within the same report.

These changes, along with a minor fix to handle missing or `None` `group` attributes during internal row ID generation, collectively lead to more resilient components, fewer unexpected failures, and more reliable data pipelines, especially when dealing with APIs that may occasionally return inconsistent or sparse data.
