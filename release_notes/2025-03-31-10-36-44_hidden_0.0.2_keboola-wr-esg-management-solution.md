Title:
Enhanced Sync Actions Default Values

Excerpt:
Improved user experience with default values for client_id and entity_period in sync actions.

Post Detail:
In the latest update (version 0.0.2) of the component-esg repository, we have introduced default values for client_id and entity_period in sync actions. This enhancement simplifies the user experience by automatically populating these fields, saving time and reducing the likelihood of errors during configuration. Users can now initiate sync actions more efficiently, with the option to customize these values as needed. This update streamlines the workflow, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. Upgrade to version 0.0.2 to take advantage of these improved default settings in sync actions.
