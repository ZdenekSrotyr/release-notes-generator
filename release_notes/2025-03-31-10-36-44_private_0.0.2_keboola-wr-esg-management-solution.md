## Change log (AI generated):
Simplified ESG Sync Actions Configuration
We've added default values for `client_id` and `entity_period` in ESG sync actions, simplifying configuration.

We've updated the configuration for sync actions within the ESG component. Specifically, the `client_id` and `entity_period` parameters are no longer mandatory.

Previously, you might have needed to explicitly define these values in your configuration. Now, if you omit `client_id` or `entity_period` when setting up a sync action, the component will automatically use `None` as their default value. This adjustment provides greater flexibility and can simplify configurations where these specific parameters are not required for your use case.



## Changes:



- default values of client_id and entity_period for sync actions
