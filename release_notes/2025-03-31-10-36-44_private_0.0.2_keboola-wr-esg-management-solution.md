## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Flexibility for Component Synchronous Actions
Components running synchronous actions are now more resilient, gracefully handling optional `client_id` and `entity_period` parameters.

We have updated how components handle synchronous actions to improve robustness and flexibility.

Previously, if the `client_id` or `entity_period` parameters were not explicitly provided in the configuration for a synchronous action, the component could encounter an error, preventing execution.

With this update, these parameters now default to `None` if not supplied. This allows synchronous actions to proceed even without these specific parameters being set, enhancing component resilience. The component's specific logic or the downstream service will determine how these `None` values are handled.



## Changes:



- default values of client_id and entity_period for sync actions
