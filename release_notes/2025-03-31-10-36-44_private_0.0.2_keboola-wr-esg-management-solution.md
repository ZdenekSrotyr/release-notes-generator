## Change log (AI generated):
## New Sync Action for Available Periods Metadata

A new sync action has been added to facilitate fetching available periods metadata for UI configuration without specific client filters.

We have introduced a new sync action named `get_available_periods_all_clients`. When invoked, this action calls the underlying `api.get_available_periods` method without passing the `client_id` and `entity_period` parameters.

This differs from the existing `get_available_periods` sync action, which includes these parameters in the API call. The new action modifies how metadata regarding available periods is retrieved, potentially fetching periods across all clients or based on API-defined defaults, specifically for UI configuration purposes. This change does not affect the primary data extraction or processing logic during component runs.



## Changes:



- default values of client_id and entity_period for sync actions
