## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Update: client_id and entity_period Parameters Now Optional
Enjoy increased flexibility as client_id and entity_period become optional for select component actions.

We've updated the component to provide more flexibility in configuration. The input parameters client_id and entity_period are no longer strictly required when using the run, get_questionnaires, or get_entities actions.

This change means the component can proceed even if these parameters are omitted from your configuration. In such cases, the component will likely rely on default values or specific API behaviors to determine the client_id and entity_period. Please be aware that this might alter the scope of data fetched or processed compared to configurations where these parameters were explicitly set. Review your component setup to ensure it aligns with your intended data scope.



## Changes:



- default values of client_id and entity_period for sync actions
