## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced ESG Sync: Optional Client & Period Filters
Sync actions in the ESG component can now run without specifying `client_id` or `entity_period` filters.

We have updated the ESG component to handle optional `client_id` and `entity_period` parameters during synchronization actions. These parameters can now be omitted from the configuration.

If these parameters are not provided, the component will fetch data without applying the corresponding filters in the API request. This allows for greater flexibility in data extraction, such as retrieving data across all clients or periods if desired. Be aware that omitting these previously required filters might change the scope and volume of data extracted compared to previous runs.



## Changes:



- default values of client_id and entity_period for sync actions
