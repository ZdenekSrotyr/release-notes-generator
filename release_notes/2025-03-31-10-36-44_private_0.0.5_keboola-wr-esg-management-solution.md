## Change log (AI generated):
## Extractor Update: Improved Parameter Handling
The data extractor now processes configuration parameters `client_id` and `entity_period` more robustly.

We've refined how the core data extractor handles the `client_id` and `entity_period` configuration parameters. This update improves the stability and predictability of components using this extractor.

Previously, the extractor logic expected these parameters within a broader configuration dictionary. Now, the component explicitly retrieves `client_id` and `entity_period` from the configuration, providing default empty string values if they are not set. These values are then passed as distinct arguments to the extractor's main processing function.

This change ensures the extractor always receives defined values for these parameters, preventing potential errors or unexpected behavior if they were missing in the configuration. While this enhances robustness, be aware that downstream logic dependent on `client_id` or `entity_period` will now receive empty strings instead of potentially failing if these parameters are not configured.

Minor adjustments were also made to internal logging and utility functions, which do not directly impact data processing logic.



## Changes:



- default values of client_id and entity_period for sync actions
