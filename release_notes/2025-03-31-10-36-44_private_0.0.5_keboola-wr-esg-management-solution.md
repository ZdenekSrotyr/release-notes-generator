## ESG Component Enhancements: New Action and Data Fetching Updates
Introducing a new action to fetch ESG entity data, along with improved data retrieval featuring pagination, enhanced error handling, and manifest generation.

We've updated the ESG component with several improvements focused on data extraction and robustness.

A new synchronous action, `get_esg_data`, has been added. This action allows you to specifically extract 'entity' data based on `report_id`, `client_id`, and `entity_period`. Default values (`'current_client'`, `'current_period'`) are provided for convenience, and the action supports state persistence for incremental processing based on these parameters.

Data fetching logic has been significantly refactored. Core API interactions, including authentication, requests, error handling, and retries, are now centralized in a dedicated class. This change improves the reliability and maintainability of data retrieval from the source API.

Pagination support has been implemented when fetching entities, ensuring all available records are retrieved from the source API, potentially increasing the volume of entity data processed compared to fetching only the first page.

Additionally, the component now generates Keboola manifest files for output tables. This includes the ability to define primary keys, improving table structure management in Keboola Storage.



## Changes:
