## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Entity and Period Format Modification

Excerpt: Data parsing and processing will be impacted due to format changes.

Post detail: 
The format of the entity and period in the data processing has been altered. The two are now separated by a space, which will affect the parsing and processing of the data. If the data was previously processed with the entity and period being contiguous, updates to the parsing logic will be required to accommodate this change. The specific file and location of this change are not provided. No other changes affecting data processing, output, error handling, configuration options, or component behavior were identified.
