Title:
Improved Data Formatting: Entity and Period Now Separated by Space

Excerpt:
Enhanced user experience with a new formatting feature separating entity and period with a space for improved readability and data organization.

Post Detail:
In this update from version 0.0.5 to 0.0.6, we have introduced a significant improvement in data presentation within the component-esg repository. Users will now notice that entities and periods are displayed with a space between them, enhancing the clarity and structure of the data. This change not only improves the overall user experience but also streamlines data analysis processes by making it easier to identify and work with specific entities and periods. We believe this enhancement will greatly benefit users in efficiently navigating and interpreting data within the platform.
