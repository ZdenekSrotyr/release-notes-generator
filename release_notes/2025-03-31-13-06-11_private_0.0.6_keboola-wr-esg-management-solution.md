## Change log (AI generated):
## ESG Extractor: API Request URL Modified
The ESG Extractor's API request URL construction has been altered, which may impact data fetching.

We have modified the construction of the API request URL within the ESG Extractor component. Specifically, a space has been added between the entity identifier and the `/period/` segment in the URL path generated within the `_fetch_data` method of `src/component/esg_extractor.py`.

This change alters the specific URL used when the component fetches data from the source API. Consequently, this modification is likely to cause API requests to fail or return unexpected results, impacting the data successfully retrieved into your Keboola project by this component.



## Changes:



- entity and period separated by space
