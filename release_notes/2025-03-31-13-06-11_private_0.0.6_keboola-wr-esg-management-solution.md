## Change log (AI generated):
## ESG Connector: Updated Search Query Format
The ESG data connector now uses a refined search query format when communicating with the external API.

We have updated the way search queries are constructed within our ESG data connector. Previously, the entity name and the reporting period were combined directly (e.g., "Apple2023"). Now, these elements are separated by a space (e.g., "Apple 2023").

This change modifies the search text sent to the external ESG API. As a result, the search results returned by the API may differ from those received in previous component runs. Please be aware that this could lead to variations in the specific data retrieved and processed by the connector.



## Changes:



- entity and period separated by space
