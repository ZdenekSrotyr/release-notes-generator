**Component:** [keboola.wr-esg-management-solution](https://github.com/keboola/component-esg)  
**Tag:** [0.0.6](https://github.com/keboola/component-esg/releases/tag/0.0.6)  
**Stage:** PRIVATE


## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Update: Space Separator in Table Names
Generated table names now use a space instead of an underscore as a separator between entity and period parameters.

We've refined the naming convention for output tables generated by certain components. Specifically, the separator used between the entity and period parameters (e.g., `refinitiv_entity` and `refinitiv_period`) in generated table names has been updated from an underscore (`_`) to a space (` `).

This change impacts how output table manifests are named. If you have processes, scripts, or downstream dependencies that rely on the previous underscore-based naming format, please update them to reflect the new space-separated convention.



## Changes:



- entity and period separated by space
