## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Enhanced Entity and Period Identification

Excerpt: Refined logic now separates entity and period data based on the first space.

Post detail:
We've updated the data parsing logic responsible for identifying and separating 'entity' and 'period' values from combined source strings. Previously, the system split these strings based on the last detected year pattern (YYYY).

The new implementation, located in the updated `src/parser_v2.py` file (replacing `src/parser.py`), now splits the combined string at the first encountered space. The text before the space is assigned to the 'entity' column, and the text after the space is assigned to the 'period' column. This change is activated via updates in `component.py` which now utilizes the new parser.

This revised approach alters how the `entity` and `period` columns are populated from the source data. Source rows where the combined entity/period string does not strictly follow an "[Entity Name] [Period]" format, particularly where entity names contain spaces before the period part, may now be parsed differently.
