## Change log (AI generated):
## Output Table Naming Convention Change
Output table names generated by this component now use a space separator instead of an underscore.

The naming convention for output tables created by this component in Keboola Storage has been updated.
Previously, when combining the `entity` and `period` parameters to generate the output table name, an underscore (`_`) was used as a separator. This has now been changed to a space (` `).
This modification only affects the name of the output table identifier in Storage. The data content within the table is not impacted by this change. Please be aware of this updated naming format when referencing output tables generated with the latest version of this component.



## Changes:



- entity and period separated by space
