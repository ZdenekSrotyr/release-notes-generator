## Change log (AI generated):
## Company-Period Identifier Format Updated
The format for combined company and time period identifiers now includes a space, potentially affecting derived data keys.

We have implemented a change in how combined identifiers for companies and time periods are generated within certain components. This update modifies the structure of the key used internally to associate data with a specific company over a specific period.

Previously, these identifiers were created by directly concatenating the company identifier and the period string (e.g., `COMPANYIDFY2023`). The updated format now inserts a space between these two elements, resulting in an identifier like `COMPANYID FY2023`.

This change affects the key value used for data association. If your downstream processes, transformations, or output files rely on this specific combined identifier format, please review your configurations and update them accordingly to accommodate the newly introduced space. This ensures continued accuracy in data grouping, storage, and joins based on this identifier.
