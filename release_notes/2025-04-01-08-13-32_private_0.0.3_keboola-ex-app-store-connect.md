## App Store Connect Extractor Update: Enhanced Reliability and Gzip Support
This update improves the Apple App Store Connect extractor with standardized OAuth2 authentication, Gzip decompression, better error handling, and stricter configuration validation for more robust data extraction.

We've released an update for the Apple App Store Connect extractor (version 0.0.3), focusing on enhanced reliability and data handling capabilities.

Key improvements include:
*   **Standardized Authentication:** The extractor now uses a more robust OAuth2 flow (Bearer token) for authenticating with the Apple API, replacing the previous per-request token generation.
*   **Gzip Decompression:** Added support for automatic Gzip decompression, enabling the extractor to process compressed report files directly from the API. This prevents failures that might have occurred with gzipped reports previously.
*   **Improved API Resilience:** API interactions are now more robust. The extractor includes improved retry logic, specifically handling API rate limits (HTTP 429 errors), and features better detection of API-specific issues, leading to more successful and reliable data downloads.
*   **Stricter Configuration Validation:** Input configuration is now validated more strictly, checking report frequency and subtype combinations to prevent errors and ensure setups align correctly with Apple's requirements before processing begins.

These enhancements work together to provide a more stable and reliable experience when extracting data from the App Store Connect API.
