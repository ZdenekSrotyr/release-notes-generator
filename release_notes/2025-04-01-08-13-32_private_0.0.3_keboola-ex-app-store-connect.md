## Change log (AI generated):
App Store Connect Component Update: Enhanced Reliability & Data Integrity
Ensures consistent report encoding and improves operational stability for the App Store Connect component.

We've updated the App Store Connect component to enhance data integrity and operational reliability.

Output reports generated by the component are now explicitly saved with UTF-8 encoding. This change prevents potential encoding errors and ensures data consistency when working with reports in downstream systems.

Additional improvements focus on robustness:
*   Stricter validation is now applied to input configuration parameters like frequency, report type, and report subtype, preventing runs with invalid settings.
*   Enhanced error handling has been implemented for the report saving process, providing clearer information in case of issues.
*   A default timeout has been added to API requests, improving the component's resilience during data fetching operations.
