Title: App Store Connect Extractor Update: Configuration Changes Required

Excerpt: Configuration adjustments are necessary for the App Store Connect extractor due to updated filter parameters and stricter validation rules.

Post detail:
We've updated the App Store Connect extractor with several changes, including modifications that require your attention. Key configuration parameters used for filtering reports during API calls have been renamed: `dimension_filter_key` is now `filter_key`, and `dimension_filter_value` is now `filter_value`. Please update your existing configurations to use these new parameter names to ensure the correct data is retrieved.

Additionally, report configuration validation is now stricter. The parameters `report_type`, `frequency`, `filter_key`, and `filter_value` are all mandatory and must be provided in your configuration. Runs with configurations missing these previously optional parameters will now fail, enforcing more explicit data filtering. Ensure all configurations include values for these parameters.

Alongside these configuration changes, we've enhanced the extractor's reliability by introducing automatic retries for API calls and improving error handling. Other internal improvements include refactoring authentication logic, output file naming logic, class structures, and logging for better maintainability and observability.
