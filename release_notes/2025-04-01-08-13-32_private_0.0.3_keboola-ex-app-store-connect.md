## Change log (AI generated):
## App Store Connect: Control Your Report Granularity (Daily to Yearly)
Configure the App Store Connect component to fetch reports daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly for tailored data granularity.

We've updated the App Store Connect component to give you more control over your report data. You can now specify the desired report frequency directly in the component configuration.

Choose between `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, or `YEARLY` frequencies. This setting adjusts the time granularity of the data requested from the App Store Connect API, allowing you to fetch data aggregated over the period that best suits your analysis needs, instead of relying on a fixed frequency.

Additionally, the component now automatically handles gzipped report downloads from the API. It requests compressed data and decompresses it seamlessly, leading to more efficient data retrieval without changing the structure of your final output tables.
