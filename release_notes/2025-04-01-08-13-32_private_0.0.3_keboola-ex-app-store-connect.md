## Enhanced Reliability for App Store Connect Extractor
Our App Store Connect extractor now features automatic API retries, significantly improving data download reliability.

We've enhanced the App Store Connect extractor to make your data retrieval more robust. The extractor now automatically retries requests to the Apple App Store Connect API (`api.appstoreconnect.apple.com`) if they initially fail due to temporary network issues or server glitches.

This improvement significantly increases the reliability of fetching report lists and downloading individual reports. By automatically handling transient errors, the extractor is more likely to successfully deliver your crucial App Store data without manual intervention, ensuring smoother and more dependable data pipelines.

Alongside this key enhancement, we've implemented several backend improvements, including standardized file handling, better error reporting, and enhanced logging, further bolstering the component's overall stability and maintainability.
