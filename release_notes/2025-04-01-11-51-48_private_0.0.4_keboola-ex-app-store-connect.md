## Change log (AI generated):
## App Store Connect Component: Report Subtype Logic Update
Report subtype for App Store Connect reports is now derived directly from the selected frequency.

We have updated the logic for determining the report subtype in the App Store Connect component. Previously, the `report_subtype` was used directly when creating a report request. Now, it is derived automatically from the selected `frequency` parameter ('DAILY', 'WEEKLY', 'MONTHLY', 'YEARLY') during report request generation within the `ReportAttributes` class initialization.

This modification alters how the report request is constructed and sent to the App Store Connect API. Depending on the mapping between `frequency` and the resulting `report_subtype`, the specific report type requested may differ compared to previous component versions if a specific `report_subtype` value was previously utilized that does not directly correspond to the standard frequency options.



## Changes:



- fix UI, fix creating report request
