## Change log (AI generated):
## Accurate Report Frequency in App Store Connect Extractor
The App Store Connect component now correctly sends the specified report frequency to the API, ensuring accurate report retrieval.

We have corrected an issue in the App Store Connect component regarding the `frequency` parameter sent to the App Store Connect API. Previously, the value sent might not have perfectly matched the intended configuration.

The component now ensures the correct string value, derived from the validated `frequency` setting (`DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, `YEARLY`), is used when creating report requests. This guarantees that report generation and retrieval align precisely with the frequency specified in your component configuration. Depending on how the API previously interpreted potentially incorrect values, this might adjust the specific reports being fetched.

Alongside this correction, we have implemented stricter validation for the `frequency` parameter using specific allowed values (`DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, `MONTHLY`, `YEARLY`) and refactored related configuration handling code to improve robustness and maintainability.



## Changes:



- fix UI, fix creating report request
