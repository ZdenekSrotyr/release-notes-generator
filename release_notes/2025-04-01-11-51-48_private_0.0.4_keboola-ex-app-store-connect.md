## App Store Connect Component: Report Fix and Version Configuration
Our App Store Connect component now correctly requests sales reports and allows configuration of the desired API report version.

We've updated the App Store Connect component to improve report requesting and provide more flexibility.

First, we've addressed an issue where the top-level report type in the API request payload could vary. This field is now consistently set to request "salesReports", ensuring the correct type of report is fetched from the App Store Connect API, regardless of the specific `report_type` parameter configured (which still correctly influences the nested report details). This enhances the reliability of data extraction for sales reports.

Second, you can now specify the desired API report version using the new `report_version` configuration parameter. Previously, this was fixed. This update gives you control over which version of the App Store Connect reporting API is used, allowing access to potentially different data structures or fields available in specific API versions. Remember to check the App Store Connect documentation if you change the version, as it might alter the output data format.
