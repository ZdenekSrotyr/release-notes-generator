## Change log (AI generated):
## App Store Connect Extractor: Fresh Reports Every Time
Our App Store Connect extractor now ensures fresh report data on every run by always creating new report requests and using parameters directly from your configuration.

We've updated the App Store Connect extractor to enhance how it requests and retrieves report data.

Previously, the extractor could potentially reuse an existing report request ID. Now, it consistently creates a *new* report request for every run. This change guarantees that the data fetched always reflects the specific configuration parameters set for that particular execution, ensuring data freshness and relevance. You will no longer receive data corresponding to an older, pre-existing report instance.

Additionally, the way parameters (like filters, dimensions, and metrics) are sent to the App Store Connect API has been streamlined. The extractor now directly uses the parameters defined in your component configuration (`parameters` object). This offers greater flexibility in defining your report requests. Please ensure your configuration parameters align with the structure expected by the App Store Connect API for accurate data retrieval.

These updates improve the reliability and accuracy of the data fetched by the App Store Connect extractor, ensuring you always work with information based on your latest settings.
