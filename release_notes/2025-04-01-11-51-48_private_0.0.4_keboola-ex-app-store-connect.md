## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Fine-tune App Store Connect Reports

**Excerpt:** Customize App Store Connect report requests with additional parameters.

**Post detail:**
We've enhanced the App Store Connect component to offer greater flexibility in report generation. You can now include an `additional_information` field in your report configuration.

This new capability allows you to pass specific parameters directly into the report creation request sent to the App Store Connect API. By leveraging this, you can customize the report requests to alter the scope, granularity, or type of data retrieved, such as applying filters like `filter[reportSubType]=SUMMARY`. This provides more precise control over the data extracted from App Store Connect.



## Changes:



- fix UI, fix creating report request
