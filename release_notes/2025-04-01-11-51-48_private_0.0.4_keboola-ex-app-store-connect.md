## Change log (AI generated):
## Refined Filtering for App Store Connect Reports
An update to the App Store Connect report downloader improves how filters are applied for more accurate data retrieval.

We've refined the way filters are applied when requesting reports via the App Store Connect API. This internal update modifies how the `filter` parameter is constructed when sending requests for reports.

Previously, the filter configuration was sent directly. Now, the system iterates through your specified filter items and formats each one correctly according to the API's expected structure (`{'dimensionKey': ..., 'optionKeys': ...}`) within a list. This change, implemented in our `report_downloader.py` script, ensures better compliance with the App Store Connect API requirements.

This refinement aims to improve the accuracy of filtering, potentially affecting which data rows are returned based on your configuration by ensuring the API interprets your filter criteria correctly. No other data processing aspects were changed in this update.
