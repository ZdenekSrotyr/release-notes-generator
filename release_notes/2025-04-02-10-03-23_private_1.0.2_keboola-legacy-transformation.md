## Change log (AI generated):
## Seamless Multi-Backend Support & Stability Fix
Enhanced component flexibility allows seamless operation across Snowflake, Redshift, Synapse, and BigQuery backends, with improved configuration handling.

This update introduces dynamic backend handling within our components. Now, components can automatically detect and adapt their behavior based on the specific database backend (Snowflake, Redshift, Synapse, or BigQuery) specified in your configuration's `image_parameters`. This ensures the correct logic and SQL variations are used for your target environment, preventing errors and streamlining data processing across different platforms.

Additionally, we've resolved a potential type error that could occur when reading the backend type from the configuration. This fix enhances stability, ensuring the component reliably identifies the specified backend and operates correctly, leading to smoother and more dependable data operations.
