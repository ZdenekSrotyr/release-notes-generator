## Change log (AI generated):
## Components Now Adapt to Your Data Backend
Components can now leverage specific data backend features (e.g., Snowflake, Synapse) for potentially optimized data operations, falling back to standard methods when needed.

We've updated component logic to dynamically detect the target data backend (like Snowflake or Synapse) based on the `KBC_BACKEND_TYPE` environment variable. When a supported backend is identified, the component will attempt to use a dedicated backend connector for data operations.

This change allows transformations to potentially utilize backend-specific features or optimizations, moving beyond reliance on CSV downloads/uploads via the Storage API for all scenarios. The method used for reading input tables and writing output tables now depends on the detected backend type.

To ensure reliability and backward compatibility, we've implemented a fallback mechanism. If a dedicated backend connector cannot be initialized (e.g., for an unsupported backend type), the component automatically reverts to its previous behavior, using the standard Storage API methods (CSV download/upload). Internal data handling functions have been refactored to seamlessly support both the new dynamic backend connectors and the legacy approach, incorporating type checks for improved robustness.
