## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Enhanced Script Encoding & Configuration Stability

**Excerpt:** Update enhances script handling with UTF-8 encoding and stabilizes backend selection configuration.

**Post Detail:**
We've improved component reliability with two key updates. First, scripts generated from configurations now explicitly use UTF-8 encoding. This ensures that scripts containing non-ASCII characters, such as accents or special symbols, are handled correctly during execution, preventing potential misinterpretations or errors.

Second, we've stabilized the component configuration process related to backend selection. By adding type casting for the backend parameter, we've fixed potential `TypeError` exceptions that could interrupt configuration. This results in a more reliable setup experience when choosing your backend. The dynamic backend selection helper in the UI now also strictly presents predefined options based on your input, preventing arbitrary values from being temporarily added during the selection process.
