## SQL Transformation Component: Enhanced Backend Handling and Stability
Updates to the SQL Transformation component enhance backend configuration handling and fix a related bug for improved reliability.

We've refined the SQL Transformation component's logic for managing backend database connections. This internal improvement enhances how the component determines and connects to your target database, potentially allowing for more dynamic backend configurations in the future.

Additionally, we've resolved a bug related to backend parameter handling. This fix prevents potential runtime errors during the setup of transformation executions, leading to more stable and reliable processing of your SQL transformations.
