## Change log (AI generated):
## Refined Backend Selection and Configuration Handling
Improved backend selection logic and robust handling of the `packages` parameter enhance transformation reliability.

We've refined how transformation components determine the target database backend. The system now checks for the backend in the following order: first in `parameters.backend`, then `image_parameters.backend_from_config`, followed by the `KBC_PROJECT_BACKEND` environment variable, and finally defaults to 'snowflake' if none are specified. This clearer hierarchy ensures your SQL code runs against the intended backend, preventing potential syntax errors or connection issues.

Additionally, we've enhanced configuration handling by adding explicit type checking for the `packages` parameter. It is now consistently treated as a list, defaulting to an empty list if not provided. This improvement prevents potential `TypeError` exceptions during component initialization, making transformations more robust against malformed configurations and allowing data processing to proceed smoothly.
