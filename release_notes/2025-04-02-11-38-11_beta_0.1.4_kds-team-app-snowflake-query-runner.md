**Component:** [kds-team.app-snowflake-query-runner](https://github.com/keboola/component-snowflake-query-runner)  
**Tag:** [0.1.4](https://github.com/keboola/component-snowflake-query-runner/releases/tag/0.1.4)  
**Stage:** BETA


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Addition of Key-Pair Authentication

Excerpt: Change in authentication method may affect component's behavior.

Post detail: 

1. Key-Pair Authentication Added: The component now uses key-pair authentication to connect to Snowflake. This could potentially alter the component's behavior if authentication fails. Multiple files have been modified to implement this change.

2. Parameter Changes: The parameters for Credentials have been corrected. This change could affect the component's behavior if the parameters are not set correctly. The change was made in a single file.

3. Default Authentication Type Altered: The default authentication type is now key-pair. A check for correct authentication setup has also been added. This change was made in a single file and could affect the default authentication method and error checks.

Please note that the actual impact on data processing and component behavior should be verified through testing.
