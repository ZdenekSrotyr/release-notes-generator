## Change log (AI generated):
Title: New Child Tables and Columns Added to 'selections'

Excerpt: Data structure expansion impacts data processing and output.

Post Detail:
In the latest release, new child tables 'modifiers', 'appliedDiscounts', and 'appliedTaxes' have been added. Additionally, new columns have been introduced to the 'selections' table. These changes expand the data structure, affecting data processing and output. 

A change in the data mapping has also been implemented. This alteration changes the organization and relationship of data, which will also impact data processing and the structure of the output data.

In non-data changes, the 'build-essential' package has been removed, reducing the size of the docker image. This change may improve the efficiency of data processing, but does not directly affect the data or its processing.

Please note, specific files and locations of these changes are not provided in this release note. For a more detailed analysis, direct access to the codebase and the specific changes made would be required.
