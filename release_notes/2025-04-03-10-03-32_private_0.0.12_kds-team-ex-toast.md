## Enhanced Data Extraction: Access New Data Points and Columns

Gain deeper insights with newly available data tables for modifiers, applied discounts, and applied taxes, plus expanded information within the selections table.

We've significantly enhanced our data extraction capabilities, giving you access to more granular information. This update introduces extraction support for several new data endpoints and enriches existing ones.

Key updates include:

*   **New Data Tables:** You can now extract and analyze data from three new endpoints, resulting in the following tables:
    *   `modifiers`
    *   `appliedDiscounts`
    *   `appliedTaxes`
    These additions provide more detailed operational or financial context for your analyses.
*   **Expanded `selections` Table:** We've added new columns to the `selections` table, offering a more comprehensive view within this existing dataset.
*   **Updated Mapping Rules:** Underlying data mapping rules have been refined to improve the structure, consistency, and accuracy of the extracted data across various tables.

These enhancements allow for richer analysis and a more complete understanding of your data landscape directly within Keboola.
