## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Addition of New Child Tables and Columns

Excerpt: The data structure has been updated with new child tables and columns, potentially impacting downstream data processing and analysis tasks.

Post Detail:

DATA CHANGES:

- Three new child tables, 'modifiers', 'appliedDiscounts', and 'applied taxes', have been added. The inclusion of these tables will result in more intricate data output, which may affect subsequent data processing and analysis tasks.

- New columns have been added to the 'selections' table. This change in the table's structure and content may impact data processing tasks relying on the previous structure.

OTHER CHANGES:

- The 'build-essential' package has been removed from the Docker image. This change decreases the Docker image size, potentially resulting in faster build and deployment times. It is not expected to affect data processing capabilities unless the 'build-essential' package was used in those tasks.

- Data mapping has been altered. This change can significantly affect data processing and output. Systems or processes relying on the previous data mapping may need to be updated to accommodate these changes. Specific details on the mapping changes were not provided.
