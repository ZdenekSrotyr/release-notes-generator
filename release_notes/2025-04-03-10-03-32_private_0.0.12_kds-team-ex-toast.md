## Change log (AI generated):
## Granular Order Data: Modifiers, Discounts, and Taxes Added
Extract detailed modifier, discount, and tax information alongside enriched selection data with this component update.

This update enhances data extraction capabilities by introducing new child tables and enriching an existing one.

Extraction logic has been added to process nested data structures, creating three new output tables: `modifiers`, `appliedDiscounts`, and `appliedTaxes`. These tables capture granular details associated with order selections and are linked accordingly.

Additionally, the existing `selections` table has been expanded with new columns, providing further detail extracted directly from the source API response.

The component's mapping configuration has been updated to accommodate these changes, ensuring data from the relevant source fields is correctly routed to the new tables and columns in the output schema.
