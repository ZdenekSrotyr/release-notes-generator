## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock Granular Data: New Extraction Tables & Columns
Introducing new extraction tables for modifiers, discounts, and taxes, plus expanded data in the 'selections' table for more detailed analysis.

We've enhanced our data extraction capabilities to provide you with more detailed insights. This update introduces three new child tables: `modifiers`, `appliedDiscounts`, and `appliedTaxes`. These tables capture granular information related to your order items and checks, offering a richer understanding of transaction details like specific adjustments, applied discounts, and tax breakdowns.

Furthermore, the existing `selections` table has been expanded with additional columns, enriching the data available for analysis. Please note that underlying data mapping configurations were adjusted to support these enhancements, which might result in minor structural or naming updates in some output tables. This update empowers you to perform more detailed analysis and gain deeper insights from your extracted data.
