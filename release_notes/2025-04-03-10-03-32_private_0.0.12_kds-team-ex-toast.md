## Component Update: New Tables for Modifiers, Discounts, and Taxes
This update extracts previously nested order and check details into new, dedicated tables for modifiers, applied discounts, and applied taxes.

We have updated the component's processing logic to extract detailed information previously nested within the `orders` and `checks` streams. This data is now available in three new, separate output tables: `modifiers`, `appliedDiscounts`, and `appliedTaxes`.

Specifically, `modifiers` and `appliedDiscounts` data are extracted from the `selections` array within the `orders` stream. `appliedTaxes` data is extracted from the `checks` stream. This change transforms complex nested data into a structured, relational format, making it easier to access and analyze details about order modifications, applied discounts, and taxes.

To support this, the component now officially recognizes these new tables. We have also updated the output preparation logic to generate the necessary manifest files, including primary key definitions, ensuring these tables are correctly configured in Keboola Storage.

- remove unnecessary build-essential package ðŸ§¹ 




- adding modifiers and appliedDiscounts child tables, added columns to selections table
