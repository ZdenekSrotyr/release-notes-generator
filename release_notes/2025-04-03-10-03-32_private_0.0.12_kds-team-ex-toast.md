## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Order Data Extraction: Modifiers, Discounts, Taxes Added
Access richer order details with new tables for modifiers, applied discounts, and applied taxes, plus expanded selection data.

We've significantly enhanced our data extraction capabilities, focusing on providing more granular details about orders processed through our Python components.

This update introduces three new child tables related to order items, allowing for more detailed analysis:
*   `modifiers`: Contains details about modifications applied to order items.
*   `appliedDiscounts`: Captures information about discounts applied specifically to individual order items.
*   `appliedTaxes`: Provides data on taxes applied at the order item level.

Furthermore, the existing `selections` table mapping has been expanded to include additional columns, enriching the data available for analysis. Data mapping rules across various tables have also been refined to improve the accuracy and structure of the output data.

These changes provide a more comprehensive view of order composition, pricing, and tax details, enabling deeper insights directly within your Keboola projects.
