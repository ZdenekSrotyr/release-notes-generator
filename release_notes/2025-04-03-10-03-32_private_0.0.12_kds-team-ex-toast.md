Extractor Update: Access New Detail Tables & Columns
Gain deeper insights with new modifier, discount, and tax tables, plus enhanced selection data.

We've expanded the data extraction capabilities to provide more granular detail. You can now access three new child tables: `modifiers`, `appliedDiscounts`, and `appliedTaxes`. These tables offer detailed information related to parent records, such as selections, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of underlying components.

Additionally, the existing `selections` table has been enriched with new columns, providing further context and data points directly within your selection records.

To support these additions, the underlying data mapping logic has been updated to ensure accurate population of these new tables and columns from the source data.



## Changes:



- remove unnecessary build-essential package ðŸ§¹ 




- adding modifiers and appliedDiscounts child tables, added columns to selections table 






- added applied taxes child table 






- mapping - analyze further 




- change mapping 




- PR #8
