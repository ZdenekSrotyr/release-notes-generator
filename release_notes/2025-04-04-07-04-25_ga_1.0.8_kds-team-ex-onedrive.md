## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Enhanced Error Handling and HTTP Library Version Lock

Excerpt: Improved robustness of data synchronization and error handling processes.

Post Detail:

1. A secondary attempt to locate the library in the Sync action was added, providing a fallback mechanism and potentially improving the robustness of the data synchronization process.

2. Error handling was improved with the addition of a catch for 'id' key errors, enhancing the resilience of the component against unexpected errors.

3. The HTTP library version was locked to a specific, known-working version to prevent potential issues caused by library updates.

Note: The specific file locations for these changes were not provided in the commit messages.
