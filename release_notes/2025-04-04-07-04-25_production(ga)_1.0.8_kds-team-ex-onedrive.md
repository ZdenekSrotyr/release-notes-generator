## Change log (AI generated):
Title: SharePoint Connector: Enhanced Reliability & Robustness

Excerpt: Enhanced SharePoint source finding and resilience against API inconsistencies.

Post detail:
We've enhanced the reliability of connecting to your SharePoint data sources. The component now includes a fallback mechanism to identify SharePoint sites or libraries using alternative ID formats, improving compatibility, especially with configurations potentially derived from sync actions where the primary lookup might have previously failed.

Furthermore, we've increased the component's robustness. It now gracefully handles cases where items returned by the SharePoint API might be missing expected identifiers. Instead of causing the run to fail, the component will log the issue and attempt to continue processing other available data, preventing unexpected interruptions. Enhanced debug logging has also been added to improve observability during troubleshooting.
