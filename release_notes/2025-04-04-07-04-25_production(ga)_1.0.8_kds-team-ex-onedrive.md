## Change log (AI generated):
## Connect to More SharePoint Sites with OneDrive Component Update
The OneDrive component now more reliably identifies SharePoint sites/drives using a new fallback mechanism, improving connection flexibility.

We've enhanced the Keboola OneDrive component to improve how it identifies SharePoint sites and drives during Sync Actions. The component now uses a more flexible approach to locate the correct site or drive ID based on your configuration.

Previously, the component primarily looked for a specific identifier (`sharepointIds.siteId`). With this update, if that primary identifier isn't found in the configuration, the component automatically attempts to use an alternative identifier (`id`). This fallback mechanism increases compatibility, allowing the component to connect successfully to a wider range of SharePoint sites, especially those identified using different key structures.

This update ensures greater robustness and flexibility when connecting the OneDrive component to your SharePoint data sources. We've also refined internal logging and error handling for this process to improve stability and make troubleshooting easier if needed.
