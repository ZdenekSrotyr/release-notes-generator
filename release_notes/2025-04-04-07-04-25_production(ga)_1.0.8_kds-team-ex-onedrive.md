## SharePoint Connector: Improved Library Discovery and Robustness
Enhanced SharePoint integration finds libraries more reliably, handling underscore/space name variations and increasing robustness against API inconsistencies.

We have released updates to our SharePoint integration component to improve the reliability of finding specified libraries.

The component now includes fallback logic when searching for a SharePoint library. If the initial search using the exact name provided in the configuration fails, the component will automatically replace underscores in the name with spaces and attempt the search again. This helps locate libraries correctly even when the configuration uses underscores while the actual SharePoint library name uses spaces.

Additionally, error handling during the library search process has been strengthened. If the SharePoint API returns a library entry missing the expected 'id' field, the component will now log a warning and continue searching through the remaining results, rather than failing the entire operation. This prevents issues caused by unexpected or malformed API responses for irrelevant libraries, increasing the chances of successfully finding the target library.

Minor updates include more detailed logging during the library search for easier debugging, correction of a typo in a log message, and code formatting adjustments for better maintainability. These changes do not affect data processing logic.
