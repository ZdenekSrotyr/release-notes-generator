## OneDrive Extractor: Enhanced SharePoint Compatibility and Reliability
This update improves the OneDrive Extractor's ability to connect to SharePoint sites and handle unexpected API responses, increasing overall reliability.

The latest version of the OneDrive Extractor (v1.0.8) introduces key improvements focused on robustness and wider compatibility, especially when working with SharePoint sources.

We've implemented a fallback mechanism for identifying SharePoint sites and libraries. If the initial lookup fails, the extractor now attempts a secondary method using ID formats sometimes returned by Sync Actions. This enhancement means the component can successfully locate and process data from a broader range of SharePoint configurations that might have been previously inaccessible.

Additionally, we've strengthened error handling. The extractor is now more resilient to unexpected API responses, specifically when an item (like a file or list entry) is missing its unique identifier ('id'). Instead of failing the entire job, the component will now log the issue and attempt to continue processing other valid items, leading to smoother and more reliable data extraction runs.

Internal updates, including code linting and more detailed logging, further contribute to the component's stability and ease of troubleshooting.
