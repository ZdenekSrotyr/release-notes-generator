## Change log (AI generated):
Reliably Connect to Your SharePoint Libraries
Our SharePoint connector now uses an additional method to identify libraries, improving connection reliability, especially for configurations originating from Sync Actions.

We've updated the SharePoint connector to enhance its ability to locate your target libraries and sites. By incorporating a secondary identification method, the component can now better handle variations in identifier formats, particularly those used by Sync Actions. This update directly addresses scenarios where the connector previously failed to find a correctly configured library due to specific identifier formatting, potentially enabling connections to libraries that were previously inaccessible.

In addition to the improved library identification, this update includes enhanced error handling. By specifically managing potential missing 'id' keys in data structures received from the SharePoint API, the component is now more robust against unexpected API response formats, preventing crashes. We've also added more detailed logging around library identification and other processes to aid in debugging and improve observability. Minor code style improvements and typo corrections have been applied for better maintainability.
