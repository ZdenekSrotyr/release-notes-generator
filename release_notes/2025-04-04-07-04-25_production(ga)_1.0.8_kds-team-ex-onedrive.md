## SharePoint Component Update: Enhanced Compatibility and Robustness
The SharePoint component is now more flexible in identifying sites and more resilient against potential API data issues.

We've rolled out improvements to our SharePoint component, making it more adaptable and stable for your data operations.

First, the component is now more flexible when identifying your SharePoint site or library. It can recognize configurations using an alternative identifier (`'id'`), often found in setups originating from Sync Actions. This enhances compatibility, ensuring smoother integration even if the standard `'site_id'` parameter isn't used in your configuration.

Second, we've bolstered the component's resilience against API inconsistencies. If the SharePoint API returns incomplete data for a specific library (such as a missing ID), the component will now safely skip processing that entry and log a warning, rather than stopping the entire job. This improvement ensures your data workflows continue running smoothly, preventing crashes due to malformed API responses, although affected libraries will be temporarily ignored.

These updates aim to provide a more seamless and robust experience when working with your SharePoint data in Keboola.
