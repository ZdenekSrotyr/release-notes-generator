## Change log (AI generated):
## Python CDC Component Updated for Improved Reliability

This update enhances offset commit reliability, refines heartbeat detection, and aligns snapshot modes with current Debezium standards for the Python CDC component.

The Python CDC Component (keboola/python-cdc-component) version 1.4.4 introduces several improvements focused on reliability and configuration alignment.

Offset commit management is now more robust, utilizing sink notifications from Kafka Connect to ensure progress is saved, particularly during initial snapshots that might not produce data immediately. Heartbeat detection logic has also been refined, now relying on the message's destination topic, improving offset progression during periods without data changes.

Configuration changes include disabling Debezium tombstone events (`tombstones.on.delete=false`), simplifying delete handling to rely solely on standard delete operation messages. The "Changes Only" snapshot mode now correctly uses the `no_data` setting internally and prevents the creation of initial snapshot tables, aligning its behavior with user expectations. Furthermore, the underlying Debezium connectors for MySQL and PostgreSQL have been updated to newer versions (0.14.4 and 0.17.4 respectively). Internal code refactoring was also performed to improve maintainability.



## Changes:



- sorted Debezium properties in log 




- example regex was not a valid regex ü™≤ 




- use "database" instead of "schema" in UI for MySQL üê¨ 




- Enabling Sink notifications to force offset commits for no-data snapshots 




- Detecting heartbeats based on destination not schema name 




- Disabling tombstones and removing special handling 




- Notifications are now handled only via Sink channel 




- Revert "temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI" 




- Fixed typos in notification handlers and logs 




- refactoring (mostly) the run method 




- do not create snapshots in Changes only mode üôÄ 




- fix tests for fixed Changes only mode üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- CR first round ü•ä 




- separate snapshot result methods 




- updated docstrings 




- removing unused imports 




- renaming for readability üëÄ 




- Changes only snapshot_mode in UI passes "no_data" instead of "never" 




- MySQL 0.14.4 / PostgreSQL 0.17.4
