## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Level Up Your CDC: Enhanced Debezium Integration

Excerpt: Our CDC component now uses Debezium's native notifications for more robust progress tracking and offers cleaner data handling.

Post detail:
We've updated our Change Data Capture (CDC) component for improved reliability and state management when working with Debezium. The component now leverages Debezium's sink notification channel to track the status of snapshotting and streaming processes. This replaces direct Kafka offset monitoring, providing more accurate and robust detection of process completion, especially for snapshots that might not produce data, ensuring better state consistency.

Heartbeat event detection, crucial for tracking streaming progress and managing offsets correctly, has been refined to use the message's destination field instead of the Kafka topic field. Furthermore, we've disabled the generation of tombstone events (`tombstones.on.delete=false`) by Debezium. The component no longer includes special handling for these null messages associated with deletes, resulting in a cleaner event stream.

The behavior of the "Changes only" snapshot mode has been corrected. It now correctly configures Debezium using the `no_data` setting (instead of the deprecated `never`) and explicitly skips the creation of initial snapshot artifacts, aligning the component's actions with the mode's purpose. Significant internal refactoring was also performed to improve code structure and maintainability, supporting these functional enhancements.
