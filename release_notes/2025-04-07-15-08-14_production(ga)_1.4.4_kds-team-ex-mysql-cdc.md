## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Component Update: Streamlined Processing & State Management
Version 1.4.4 streamlines CDC processing by disabling tombstone events, improving heartbeat detection, enabling sink notifications for better offset commits, and refining "Changes only" mode.

This update introduces several improvements to our Change Data Capture (CDC) component's processing logic and reliability. Delete operations from the source database will no longer generate separate tombstone events, as the component now explicitly disables the `tombstones.on.delete` Debezium property. Heartbeat message detection has also been refined, now identifying these messages based on the configured heartbeat topic name rather than the message schema.

Snapshot handling and state management see key enhancements. The component now processes Debezium Sink notifications (like `SnapshotCompleted`), ensuring Kafka offsets are committed correctly even after snapshots that capture no table changes. This improves state management and prevents potential data reprocessing on restart. Furthermore, when configured in "Changes only" mode, the component now skips the creation of potentially empty output snapshot tables, aligning behavior with the configuration intent. This mode also uses the updated Debezium `no_data` setting for `snapshot.mode`, replacing the deprecated `never`.

Significant refactoring of the core execution logic has been performed to improve code structure and maintainability. Log readability is also enhanced with alphabetically sorted Debezium properties. Finally, the "Changes only" snapshot mode option has been re-enabled in the component configuration settings.
