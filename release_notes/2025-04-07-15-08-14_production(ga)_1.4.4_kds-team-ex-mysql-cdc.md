## CDC Components Get Smarter: Enhanced Reliability & Configuration (v1.4.4)
Experience enhanced reliability and streamlined configuration in our updated CDC components (v1.4.4).

We've released version 1.4.4 for our Change Data Capture (CDC) components, focusing on improved reliability and smarter configuration handling based on the latest Debezium standards.

Key enhancements include more robust progress tracking, especially during snapshots. By utilizing Debezium's Sink Notifications, offset commits are now triggered even when snapshots involve empty tables that don't produce data records. This prevents potential stalls or data reprocessing. We've also improved how heartbeat messages are identified, making the distinction between control messages and actual data changes more reliable. Furthermore, delete operations are simplified; tombstone messages are disabled, meaning you'll now only receive the standard DELETE event message containing the row state before deletion.

Configuration has also been refined. The 'Changes only' snapshot mode now correctly uses the Debezium `no_data` setting, replacing the deprecated `never` value. In this mode, the component no longer creates unnecessary snapshot tracking artefacts in Keboola Storage, aligning behaviour with the mode's purpose of capturing schema and subsequent changes without an initial data load. These changes, along with internal code refactoring, contribute to a more robust, reliable, and maintainable CDC experience.
