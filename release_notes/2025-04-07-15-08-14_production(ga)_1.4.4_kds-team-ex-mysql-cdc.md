## Change log (AI generated):
## CDC Connector v1.4.4: Streamlined Deletes and Snapshot Handling
Our Debezium CDC connectors (v1.4.4) now offer simplified delete processing and more accurate 'Changes Only' snapshot handling.

This update to our Debezium-based Change Data Capture (CDC) connectors introduces several improvements focused on reliability and alignment with best practices.

A key change is the disabling of tombstone messages (`tombstones.on.delete=false`). Delete operations are now consistently represented by delete events containing the row's state before deletion in the `before` field. This removes the need for special handling of null-value messages (tombstones) previously used to signify deletes, simplifying downstream processing logic.

Additionally, when using the "Changes Only" snapshot mode (which now correctly maps to Debezium's `snapshot.mode=no_data`), the connector will no longer create empty tables or manifest files in Keboola Connection Storage during the initial snapshot phase. This ensures cleaner storage and aligns the connector's behavior with the expectation that this mode should only stream subsequent changes.

Finally, internal mechanisms for detecting snapshot completion and heartbeats have been refined. Relying solely on the Debezium Sink Notification channel improves the reliability of committing offsets accurately, especially after snapshots that produce no data, preventing potential replays. These updates contribute to a more robust and reliable data streaming experience.

- Fixed typos in notification handlers and logs 




- refactoring (mostly) the run method 




- do not create snapshots in Changes only mode üôÄ

- CR first round ü•ä 




- separate snapshot result methods 




- updated docstrings 




- removing unused imports 




- renaming for readability üëÄ 




- Changes only snapshot_mode in UI passes "no_data" instead of "never" 




- MySQL 0.14.4 / PostgreSQL 0.17.4
