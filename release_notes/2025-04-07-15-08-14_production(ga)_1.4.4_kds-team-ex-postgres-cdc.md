## CDC Component Update: Enhanced Reliability and Data Handling

This update enhances CDC component reliability with refined delete event processing and smarter snapshot management.

We've released an update (v1.4.4) to our Change Data Capture (CDC) component, focusing on enhanced reliability and refined data processing based on Debezium events.

Delete operations are now streamlined. The component no longer processes separate 'tombstone' messages for deletes. Instead, delete events are solely indicated by the `__op='d'` field within the regular change event message, simplifying the downstream data flow.

Snapshot behavior has also been improved. When configured for 'Changes only' mode (`snapshot_mode='no_data'`), the component now correctly skips the initial snapshot, preventing the output of initial table data when only subsequent changes are desired. Furthermore, the component now reliably records its progress even if an initial snapshot produces no data (e.g., due to filters or empty source tables). This ensures correct offset commits and prevents potential issues like re-running snapshots or incorrect processing in subsequent runs.

Internal reliability is further boosted by improved detection of Debezium heartbeat messages, leading to more accurate progress tracking within the component. These enhancements leverage Debezium's Sink notification channel for more robust internal state management based on events like snapshot completion.
