## Change log (AI generated):
Title: CDC Component v1.4.4: Enhanced Snapshot Control and Event Handling
Excerpt: Improved snapshot management and event processing reliability for the CDC component.
Post detail:
The Change Data Capture (CDC) component version 1.4.4 introduces several key improvements for enhanced reliability and control over data processing.

We've refined how the component interacts with Debezium. It now utilizes Debezium's sink notification channel to reliably detect critical events, such as snapshot completion. This replaces previous methods based on inspecting data message metadata, leading to more precise offset commits and state management.

Processing is streamlined as Debezium tombstone events for row deletions are now disabled (`tombstones.on.delete=false`). Deletions are represented solely by 'delete' operation messages containing the row's state before deletion. Additionally, the mechanism for identifying internal heartbeat messages has been adjusted for better accuracy, now checking the table name prefix.

For users needing only ongoing changes, the "Changes only" snapshot mode now correctly skips the initial full table scan, allowing processing to start directly with streaming changes from the source log. Underlying code refactoring also improves internal structure and state handling for better maintainability.



## Changes:



- sorted Debezium properties in log 




- example regex was not a valid regex ü™≤ 




- use "database" instead of "schema" in UI for MySQL üê¨ 




- Enabling Sink notifications to force offset commits for no-data snapshots 




- Detecting heartbeats based on destination not schema name 




- Disabling tombstones and removing special handling 




- Notifications are now handled only via Sink channel 




- Revert "temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI" 




- Fixed typos in notification handlers and logs 




- refactoring (mostly) the run method 




- do not create snapshots in Changes only mode üôÄ 




- fix tests for fixed Changes only mode üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- CR first round ü•ä 




- separate snapshot result methods 




- updated docstrings 




- removing unused imports 




- renaming for readability üëÄ 




- Changes only snapshot_mode in UI passes "no_data" instead of "never" 




- MySQL 0.14.4 / PostgreSQL 0.17.4
