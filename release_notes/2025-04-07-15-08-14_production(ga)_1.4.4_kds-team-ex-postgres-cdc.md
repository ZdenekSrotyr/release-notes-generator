## Change log (AI generated):
## Refined CDC Behavior: Tombstone Removal and Snapshot Updates
Our CDC component no longer produces tombstone messages for deletes and now correctly skips initial snapshots in "Changes only" mode.

We've updated our Change Data Capture (CDC) component, introducing key changes to improve its behavior and reliability.

Firstly, delete operations will no longer generate tombstone messages (Kafka messages with a key but a null value). We have configured the underlying Debezium connector with `tombstones.on.delete=false`. Please note: If your downstream processes rely on these tombstone messages to detect deleted records, you will need to adjust your logic accordingly.

Secondly, the "Changes only" snapshot mode has been refined. When selected, the component now explicitly skips the initial data snapshot phase, capturing only subsequent change events from the source database. This behavior now correctly aligns with the underlying Debezium `snapshot.mode=no_data` configuration setting, replacing the previously used deprecated value.

Additionally, several internal enhancements have been implemented, including improved heartbeat detection logic and updated event notification handling using Debezium's sink notification channel, further contributing to the component's stability and maintainability.



## Changes:



- sorted Debezium properties in log 




- example regex was not a valid regex ü™≤ 




- use "database" instead of "schema" in UI for MySQL üê¨ 




- Enabling Sink notifications to force offset commits for no-data snapshots 




- Detecting heartbeats based on destination not schema name 




- Disabling tombstones and removing special handling 




- Notifications are now handled only via Sink channel 




- Revert "temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI" 




- Fixed typos in notification handlers and logs 




- refactoring (mostly) the run method 




- do not create snapshots in Changes only mode üôÄ 




- fix tests for fixed Changes only mode üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- CR first round ü•ä 




- separate snapshot result methods 




- updated docstrings 




- removing unused imports 




- renaming for readability üëÄ 




- Changes only snapshot_mode in UI passes "no_data" instead of "never" 




- MySQL 0.14.4 / PostgreSQL 0.17.4
