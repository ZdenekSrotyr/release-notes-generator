## CDC Component Update: Enhanced Reliability and Key Behavior Changes
This update improves CDC snapshot reliability, modifies how delete events are handled, and changes the behavior of the "Changes only" mode.

We've rolled out updates to our Change Data Capture (CDC) components, focusing on improved reliability and clearer behavior during data replication. This update leverages Debezium Sink notifications to ensure Kafka offsets are committed reliably, even when snapshot phases capture schema changes but no actual data modifications. This prevents potential data reprocessing after certain snapshot scenarios.

Handling of delete operations has been streamlined. Tombstone events (messages with null payloads) are no longer generated (`tombstones.on.delete=false`). Delete operations are now exclusively represented by change events with `op='d'`, containing the state of the row *before* deletion in the `before` field. Please ensure any downstream processing relying on tombstone events is adjusted accordingly.

The behavior of the "Changes only" snapshot mode has been clarified. When selected, the component now explicitly skips the initial snapshotting phase (`snapshot.mode=no_data`). It will begin streaming changes directly from the current log position or the last saved offset, without capturing the existing data present in the source tables at startup.

Additionally, internal refactoring improves code maintainability and contributes to overall component stability.



## Changes:



- sorted Debezium properties in log 




- example regex was not a valid regex ü™≤ 




- use "database" instead of "schema" in UI for MySQL üê¨ 




- Enabling Sink notifications to force offset commits for no-data snapshots 




- Detecting heartbeats based on destination not schema name 




- Disabling tombstones and removing special handling 




- Notifications are now handled only via Sink channel 




- Revert "temporarily disable Changes only snapshot_mode in the UI" 




- Fixed typos in notification handlers and logs 




- refactoring (mostly) the run method 




- do not create snapshots in Changes only mode üôÄ 




- fix tests for fixed Changes only mode üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 




- CR first round ü•ä 




- separate snapshot result methods 




- updated docstrings 




- removing unused imports 




- renaming for readability üëÄ 




- Changes only snapshot_mode in UI passes "no_data" instead of "never" 




- MySQL 0.14.4 / PostgreSQL 0.17.4
