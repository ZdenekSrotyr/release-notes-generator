## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Added 'testConnection' sync_action and Key-Pair Authentication

Excerpt: Enhancements to component functionality and security, no direct impact on data processing.

Post detail: 

This release includes the following changes:

1. 'testConnection' sync_action: This new action allows users to test the connection to the Snowflake database. This does not directly affect data processing but enhances the component's functionality.
   
2. Key-pair authentication: A new authentication method has been added, enabling the component to use key-pair authentication when connecting to the Snowflake database. This does not directly affect data processing but enhances the component's security.

3. Removal of cryptography from requirements: The cryptography library has been removed from the component's requirements, reducing component dependencies. This does not directly affect data processing.

Please note that these changes do not directly affect how data is processed, what data is output, or how errors are handled.
