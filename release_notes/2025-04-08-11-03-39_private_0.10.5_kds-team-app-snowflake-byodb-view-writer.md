## Snowflake Component Update: RSA Key Authentication

The Snowflake component now supports RSA key-pair authentication for password-less connections and includes a connection test action.

This update introduces support for RSA key-pair authentication when connecting to Snowflake. You can now configure the component using an RSA private key instead of a password, enabling password-less connections. The component automatically selects the authentication method based on whether a `password` or `rsa_private_key` is provided in the configuration.

To help validate your credentials, especially with the new key-pair option, a `testConnection` action has been added. This allows you to verify the connection parameters without executing the main data processing logic. Additionally, internal configuration handling has been refactored using dataclasses for improved validation, and dependencies, including the Snowflake connector, have been updated. Error reporting for private key issues during authentication is also more specific.
