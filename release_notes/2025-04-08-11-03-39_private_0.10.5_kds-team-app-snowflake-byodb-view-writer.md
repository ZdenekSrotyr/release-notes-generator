## Change log (AI generated):
## Secure Connections: Key-Pair Authentication for Snowflake Views
Authenticate connections for creating Snowflake views using key pairs for enhanced security.

We've updated the component responsible for creating Snowflake views to enhance connection security. You can now authenticate your Snowflake connection using key-pair authentication.

This provides a robust and secure alternative to traditional username and password methods, aligning with security best practices. Setting up key-pair authentication involves configuring your Snowflake account and providing the necessary key details in the component configuration.

While the authentication method is new, the core functionality remains the same. The component will continue to create or replace views in your Snowflake warehouse based on your input mapping, just with an added layer of security for the connection itself.
