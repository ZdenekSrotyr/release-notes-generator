## Change log (AI generated):
Enhanced Snowflake Connection: Key-Pair Auth & Testing
Added key-pair authentication for Snowflake connections and a connection test feature.

We've enhanced how you connect to Snowflake with this component. You can now use key-pair authentication as a more secure alternative to the traditional username/password method. To utilize this, update your component configuration with your private key details.

Additionally, we've introduced a new `testConnection` action. This allows you to quickly validate your Snowflake credentials – whether using username/password or the new key-pair method – directly from the Keboola UI without needing to execute a full component run. This helps ensure your connection settings are correct upfront, supported by clearer validation feedback. Note that these updates focus on connection and configuration; the core logic for creating Snowflake views remains unchanged.
