## Change log (AI generated):
## Connect Securely: Snowflake Key-Pair Auth & Connection Test
Securely connect to Snowflake using key-pair authentication and easily test your credentials with a new connection test action.

We've enhanced how you connect to Snowflake by adding support for key-pair authentication. This provides a secure alternative to traditional password-based logins, allowing you to authenticate using a private key file for improved security practices. You can now configure your Snowflake connection using either a password or a private key and optional passphrase.

To make setup and troubleshooting easier, we've also introduced a new `testConnection` synchronous action. This allows you to quickly verify your Snowflake credentials – whether using a password or the new key-pair method – and essential permissions without needing to trigger a full run. This helps ensure your connection details are correct before processing any data.

These updates, including necessary configuration adjustments and clearer validation messages, streamline the connection process and bolster security when working with Snowflake.
