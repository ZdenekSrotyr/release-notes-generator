## Snowflake Component Update: Secure Key-Pair Auth & Connection Test
Introducing RSA key-pair authentication and a connection test action for our Snowflake component.

We've updated our Snowflake component to offer enhanced security and usability when connecting to your Snowflake warehouse.

You can now connect to Snowflake using RSA key-pair authentication, providing a more secure alternative to traditional password-based connections. Simply configure your private key details within the component setup to leverage this improved security method.

Additionally, we've added a new 'Test Connection' action. This allows you to quickly verify your Snowflake credentials and connection settings directly from the component configuration, without needing to trigger a full run. This makes setup and troubleshooting much easier. We've also improved error messages for clearer feedback on any connection or configuration issues.

These updates focus on enhancing the connection process; the core logic for generating views based on your configuration remains unchanged.
