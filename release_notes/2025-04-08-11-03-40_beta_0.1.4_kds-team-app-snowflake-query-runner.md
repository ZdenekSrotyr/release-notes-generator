## Change log (AI generated):
## Secure Your Snowflake Connection with Key-Pair Authentication
Connect to Snowflake using enhanced key-pair authentication, now available as an alternative to password authentication and set as the new default method.

We've enhanced the security and flexibility of connecting to Snowflake by adding support for key-pair authentication. You can now configure your connections using a private key file instead of relying solely on traditional password authentication.

This update introduces a more robust authentication method preferred in many security-conscious environments. Alongside this addition, we've improved configuration validation to provide clearer error messages if required parameters for your chosen authentication type are missing.

Please note: Key-pair authentication is now the default setting. If you previously relied on password authentication without explicitly setting the `auth_type` parameter, your configuration will now default to key-pair. To continue using password authentication, ensure your configuration explicitly includes `auth_type: password`. This change only affects connection setup; core data processing logic remains unchanged.
