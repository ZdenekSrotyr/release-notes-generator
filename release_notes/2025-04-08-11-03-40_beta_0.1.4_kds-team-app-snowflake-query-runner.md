## Enhanced Security: Snowflake Key Pair Authentication Now Available
Introducing enhanced security for Snowflake connections with the addition of Key Pair authentication support.

We're excited to announce an enhancement to our Snowflake components: support for Key Pair authentication. Alongside the traditional username/password method, you can now connect using a more secure private key file, offering a robust alternative for managing your credentials.

This update introduces new configuration parameters (`auth_type`, `#private_key`, `passphrase`) to facilitate this new authentication method. We've also implemented validation logic to ensure the correct parameters are provided based on your chosen authentication type, helping prevent connection issues due to misconfiguration. Support for passphrase-protected keys is included.

**Important Change:** Key Pair authentication is now the default method for new configurations. Existing components using username/password **must be updated** by explicitly setting the `auth_type` parameter to `credentials` in their configuration. Failure to do so will result in connection errors as the component will default to looking for a private key.

Upgrade your configurations to leverage this enhanced security feature for your Snowflake data operations.
