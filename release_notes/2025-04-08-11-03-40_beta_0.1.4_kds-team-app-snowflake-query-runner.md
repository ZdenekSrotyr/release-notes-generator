## Change log (AI generated):
## Secure Your Snowflake Connection with Key-Pair Authentication
Key-pair authentication is now available for Snowflake connections, offering a more secure alternative to password-based login.

We've enhanced Snowflake connection capabilities by adding support for key-pair authentication. Alongside the traditional username and password method, you can now configure connections using a private key, offering a more secure way to authenticate your Snowflake sessions.

Setting up key-pair authentication involves selecting the new authentication type in your configuration and providing the necessary private key details, including an optional passphrase if the key is encrypted. The component securely processes these credentials to establish the connection. Supporting this feature involved updating the underlying Snowflake connector library and refining how connection details are handled internally. Improved error reporting specific to key management has also been added.
