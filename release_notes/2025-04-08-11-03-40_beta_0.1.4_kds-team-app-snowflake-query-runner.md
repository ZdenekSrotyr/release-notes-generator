## Change log (AI generated):
## Key-Pair Authentication for Snowflake Components
Components connecting to Snowflake now support Key-Pair Authentication as an alternative method.

We have introduced support for Snowflake Key-Pair Authentication in components interacting with Snowflake. This provides an alternative to the existing password-based authentication.

Users can now configure their connections using a private key file and an optional passphrase by selecting the `key-pair` authentication type (`auth_type`). This requires providing the Snowflake user and the private key content. The traditional password method remains available via the `password` authentication type.

To ensure proper configuration, validation logic has been added. The component now checks that the required credentials (either password, or private key and user) are provided according to the selected `auth_type` before attempting to establish a connection. Internal credential handling has been adjusted to accommodate this new authentication mechanism.
