## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Snowflake Security: Introducing Key-Pair Authentication

Connect to Snowflake using key-pair authentication for improved security and flexibility in your data operations.

We've updated our Snowflake data source component (version 0.1.4) to enhance how you connect to your database. The primary improvement is the addition of support for key-pair authentication alongside the existing password method.

This update introduces a more secure way to authenticate your connection to Snowflake. You can now configure the component using a private key file instead of a password. Key-pair authentication is now the default method (`auth_type` parameter defaults to `KEY_PAIR`). Configuration involves setting the `auth_type` and providing your `#private_key` in the component settings.

Alongside this major feature, we've implemented stricter validation for authentication parameters. The component will now check that you've provided the correct credentials (either password or private key) based on your chosen authentication type before attempting to connect, preventing runtime errors due to misconfiguration. Connection handling has also been refactored internally for better reliability.
