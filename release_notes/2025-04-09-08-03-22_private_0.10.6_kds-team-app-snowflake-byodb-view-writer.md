## Change log (AI generated):
## Key Pair Authentication for Snowflake Connections
The BYODB View Writer component now supports Snowflake key pair authentication alongside password authentication.

The BYODB View Writer component has been updated to support key pair authentication for connecting to Snowflake databases. This provides an alternative method to the existing password authentication.

When configuring the component, you can now provide an encrypted private key (`#private_key`). The component will automatically detect the key, decrypt it using a new internal helper function, and utilize Snowflake's JWT authenticator for establishing the connection. If a private key is not provided, the component defaults to the standard password authentication method.

This update enhances the security options for accessing the target Snowflake database where views are written. The underlying logic for creating the views remains unchanged; only the authentication mechanism has been extended.
