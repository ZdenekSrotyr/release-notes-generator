## Change log (AI generated):
## Secure Snowflake Connections with Key Pair Authentication
Connect to Snowflake using secure Key Pair authentication as an alternative to traditional passwords.

We've enhanced our Snowflake connectivity options by adding support for Key Pair authentication. This provides a robust and secure alternative to password-based logins for components interacting with Snowflake.

You can now configure your Snowflake connections using either a password or a private key file. When Key Pair authentication is selected, the component will securely use your private key to establish the connection, aligning with Snowflake's recommended security practices. This offers greater flexibility and can simplify credential management, especially in automated environments.

Additionally, we have updated the underlying `snowflake-connector-python` library to version 3.8.0 to ensure compatibility and benefit from the latest improvements and fixes from Snowflake.
