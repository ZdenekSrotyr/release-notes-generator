Title: Enhanced Security: Snowflake Key-Pair Authentication

Excerpt: Securely connect to Snowflake using key-pair authentication for enhanced data access.

Support for this new authentication method has been added alongside the existing options. The component's configuration now includes fields for your private key and its passphrase (if applicable). The underlying Snowflake connector library has also been updated to version 3.8.0. No changes have been made to the core data processing logic.
