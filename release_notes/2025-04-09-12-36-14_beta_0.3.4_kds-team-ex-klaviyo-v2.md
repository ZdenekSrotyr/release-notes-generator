**Stage:** BETA


## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Framework Upgrade: kbc_runtime & Metrics
Components are now built on the `kbc_runtime` library, enabling optional metric reporting during execution.

We have updated the underlying library used for component interaction from `keboola.component.interface` to the newer `kbc_runtime.interface`. This change affects how components interact with the Keboola environment, such as reading input table and file manifests using updated methods. The core data processing logic within components remains functionally equivalent, but the library handling these interactions has been modernized. Project dependencies have also been updated to support this transition.

Additionally, components now include an optional capability to report processing metrics using the `kbc_runtime` library. If a `metric_id` is provided in the component configuration parameters, the component will report metrics like processed row counts during the data export phase. This feature adds a metric reporting step integrated into the processing workflow but does not alter the data extracted or written to output tables.
