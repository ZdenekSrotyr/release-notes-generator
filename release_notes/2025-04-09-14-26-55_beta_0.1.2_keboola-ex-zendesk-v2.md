**Component:** [keboola.ex-zendesk-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-zendesk)  
**Tag:** [0.1.2](https://github.com/keboola/component-zendesk/releases/tag/0.1.2)  
**Stage:** BETA


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Zendesk Extractor Logging Update

**Excerpt:** Logging initialization within the Zendesk extractor has been refined.

**Post detail:**
We have updated the internal logging mechanisms within the Zendesk extractor component. Specifically, the initialization of logging in the main component script (`component/component.py`) has been modified.

This internal adjustment affects how logs are generated during the component's execution, aiming for improved diagnostics. Importantly, this change does not alter the core functionality of the extractor; the way data is fetched from Zendesk, processed, and stored in Keboola remains unaffected.



## Changes:



- Description and Readme update
