## Zendesk Component Maintenance Update
Minor updates to the Zendesk component include refreshed descriptions and underlying library improvements.

The Zendesk component has received minor updates focused on metadata and dependencies.

Component descriptions (`description` and `long_description`) have been updated to provide clearer information within the Keboola UI and API. These changes enhance how the component is presented but do not alter its data extraction or processing functionality.

Additionally, the underlying `keboola-component` library has been updated to version `8.5.0`. This ensures the component utilizes the latest base library improvements. While the component's specific data handling code remains unchanged in this update, leveraging the newer library version helps maintain compatibility and incorporates potential refinements from the core library.
