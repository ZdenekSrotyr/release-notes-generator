## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved Embedding Generation for Bedrock and OpenAI
Updates to our embedding components ensure more reliable data handling and processing for AWS Bedrock and OpenAI services.

We've released updates to enhance the reliability and performance of embedding generation, particularly when using AWS Bedrock and OpenAI services within Keboola components.

Key improvements include:
*   **AWS Bedrock Integration:** We've refined how embedding vectors are extracted from AWS Bedrock API responses. By explicitly parsing the response as JSON, we ensure more robust and accurate retrieval of embedding data, improving the overall reliability when using Bedrock models.
*   **OpenAI Batching:** The logic for handling large text inputs sent to the OpenAI API has been corrected and significantly simplified. This resolves potential issues encountered when processing texts that exceeded model limits and improves the efficiency of how data is batched before being sent for embedding generation.

Additionally, we've made minor adjustments to suppress specific warnings from underlying libraries for a cleaner execution log and fixed a typo in an error message related to SageMaker batch size limits for improved clarity.

These enhancements focus on providing a more stable and reliable backend process when utilizing these popular embedding services through Keboola.
