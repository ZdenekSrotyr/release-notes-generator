**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved AWS Bedrock Embedding Integration
Updates ensure correct request/response handling and reliable processing for AWS Bedrock embeddings.

We have updated the integration with the AWS Bedrock API for generating text embeddings to improve correctness and reliability.

Key changes include correcting the format of the request sent to the Bedrock API; the input text is now correctly wrapped within a JSON structure (`{"inputText": text}`). We have also adjusted how the embedding vector is extracted from the API response, ensuring the `embedding` key is specifically targeted.

Additionally, the process for handling batches of text has been modified. Instead of a single batch API call, the system now processes each text individually using the corrected single-item logic. This ensures accurate embedding generation for every item in a batch, though it involves multiple API calls instead of one.

Other internal code adjustments include suppressing certain warnings and correcting a minor typo in code comments, which do not affect functionality.
