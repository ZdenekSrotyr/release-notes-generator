## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Components: Configurable Batch Size & API Interaction Updates

Updates to embedding components introduce configurable batch sizes and refine API interactions for OpenAI and Bedrock models.

We have updated the components responsible for generating embeddings using OpenAI and AWS Bedrock models.

A key enhancement is the introduction of a configurable `batch_size` parameter. This allows users to specify the number of records processed in each batch sent to the embedding model APIs, providing control over performance and API call patterns.

Specific changes have been made to the batching logic for different providers:
*   For OpenAI embeddings, when the configured `batch_size` is greater than 1, requests are now sent individually (batch size of 1). This modifies how data is grouped for the OpenAI API.
*   For AWS Bedrock embeddings, the batch processing logic has been adjusted, and the payload format has been corrected to use the `inputText` field as required by the Bedrock API, ensuring proper interaction.

Additionally, specific `DeprecationWarning` and `botocore.exceptions` warnings related to STS assume role functionality have been suppressed to reduce log noise during execution. These changes do not affect the core data processing logic.
