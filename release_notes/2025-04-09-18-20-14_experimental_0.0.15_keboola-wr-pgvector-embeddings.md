## Change log (AI generated):
## Embedding Generation Fix and Component Updates

Fixed an issue ensuring the correct embedding model is used during processing and updated component dependencies.

A bug was identified where the component generating embeddings might not have used the specifically configured embedding model due to a typo in the code (`embedding_model` instead of `self.embedding_model`). This could lead to errors or incorrect embeddings being generated.

This update corrects the issue, ensuring the component reliably uses the `self.embedding_model` instance as intended for processing text batches. This guarantees that the embeddings generated accurately reflect the chosen model configuration.

Additionally, we've updated several dependency packages (like `langchain`, `pandas`, `boto3`) to their newer versions and suppressed certain `FutureWarning` messages for cleaner execution logs. While these dependency updates don't alter the component's core logic, they incorporate the latest improvements and fixes from these external libraries.
