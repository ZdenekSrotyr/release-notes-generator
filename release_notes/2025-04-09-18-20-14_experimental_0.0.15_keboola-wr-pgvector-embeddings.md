## Change log (AI generated):
## Bedrock Embeddings: Enhanced Reliability and Accuracy
Ensuring correct data handling and batch processing for Amazon Bedrock embedding models.

We have implemented several fixes to enhance the reliability and accuracy of using Amazon Bedrock embedding models within the platform.

Specifically for Amazon Titan embedding models (`amazon.titan-embed-text-v1`, `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`), the input parameter key has been corrected from `inputText` to `prompt`. This ensures your text data is correctly interpreted by the Bedrock API, preventing potential errors.

Furthermore, we've refined the batch processing logic for all Bedrock models. Large datasets are now correctly processed in batches according to the specified `batch_size`, preventing potential API errors or timeouts and ensuring all data is processed reliably. This includes correcting a variable typo from `bath_size` to `batch_size` to ensure accurate batch calculation.
