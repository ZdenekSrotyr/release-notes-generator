## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Enhanced Reliability for Bedrock Embeddings

**Excerpt:** We've released important fixes for the AWS Bedrock embedding component, ensuring correct data handling and API interaction.

**Post Detail:**
This update improves the reliability and correctness of the AWS Bedrock embedding component through several key fixes.

We corrected an issue in the data batching logic. Previously, only a portion of a data batch might have been sent for processing due to incorrect slicing. This fix ensures that all rows within each calculated batch are now correctly processed together, preventing potential data loss or incomplete embedding generation.

Additionally, we modified the AWS Bedrock API calls to explicitly include `accept` and `contentType` parameters, ensuring more robust and correct interaction with the API. A typo in an embedding model parameter name was also fixed, guaranteeing the intended parameter is used during the embedding process. These changes contribute to more stable and predictable embedding generation.
