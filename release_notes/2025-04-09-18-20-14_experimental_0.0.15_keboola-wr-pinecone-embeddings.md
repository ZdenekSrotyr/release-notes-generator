**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Improved Text Embedding Reliability and Compatibility
Enhancements made to text embedding components for better reliability and improved AWS Bedrock integration.

We've rolled out improvements to components handling text embeddings, focusing on reliability and smoother operation.

This update fixes an important bug in batch processing. Previously, some texts at the very end of your input data could be skipped if the total number didn't perfectly divide by the batch size. Now, we guarantee that all your texts are correctly processed and embedded, ensuring complete results.

We have also refined the way we interact with the AWS Bedrock embedding service. A technical adjustment to our API calls enhances compatibility and aims to prevent potential warnings or errors, ensuring consistent performance when using Bedrock models.

As a minor housekeeping change, we've also suppressed some non-critical warnings from underlying libraries to provide cleaner execution logs.
