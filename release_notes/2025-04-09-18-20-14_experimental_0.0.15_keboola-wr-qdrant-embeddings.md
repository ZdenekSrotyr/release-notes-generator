## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Embedding Generation: Enhanced Reliability and Bedrock Fixes

**Excerpt:** Improved embedding generation ensures all your data is processed correctly, particularly with AWS Bedrock Titan models.

**Post Detail:**
We've implemented key fixes to enhance the reliability and correctness of embedding generation components. These updates address specific issues related to processing data with AWS Bedrock and ensure all records are handled accurately.

Previously, generating embeddings using AWS Bedrock Titan text models (`amazon.titan-embed-text-v1`, `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2`) could fail due to an incorrect API parameter. We have corrected the payload sent to the Bedrock API, ensuring these models now receive the input text correctly and generate embeddings as expected.

Additionally, we fixed an issue in the batch processing logic. The final batch of records in a dataset, if smaller than the standard batch size, was sometimes omitted. This has been resolved, guaranteeing that all records, including those in the last partial batch, are now processed and sent for embedding generation.

Minor updates include adjustments to the maximum batch sizes for certain Bedrock models (`amazon.titan-embed-text-v1`, `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2`, `cohere.embed-english-v3`, `cohere.embed-multilingual-v3`) to optimize processing patterns, and suppression of specific technical warnings to reduce log noise. These changes do not affect the embedding results for individual records.
