## Change log (AI generated):
## AI Embeddings: Updated Bedrock Interaction & OpenAI Batching

This update refines interactions with AWS Bedrock Titan and OpenAI APIs for embedding generation, alongside minor stability improvements.

The AI Embeddings component (version 0.0.15) introduces changes to how it interacts with underlying embedding services. For AWS Bedrock Titan embeddings, the `normalize` parameter is no longer explicitly sent in the API request. This change aligns with API usage but may affect the normalization of output embeddings depending on the API's default behavior.

Processing logic for OpenAI embeddings has been refined to ensure text documents are consistently handled in batches according to the specified `chunk_size`. This adjustment improves the reliability of batch processing, particularly for edge cases like single-item lists, ensuring correct interaction with the OpenAI API. The resulting embeddings per text remain unchanged, but the batch submission process is more robust.

Additionally, specific error handling for OpenAI API errors has been added for better reporting, and filters were included to suppress certain warnings from underlying libraries in the logs.
