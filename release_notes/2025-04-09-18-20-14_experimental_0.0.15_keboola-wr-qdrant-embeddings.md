## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings V2 Component Enhanced
Updated the Embeddings V2 component, improving data batching logic and addressing AWS Bedrock API compatibility.

We have updated the Embeddings V2 component used for generating text embeddings.

The primary change modifies the logic for how input data is processed in batches before being sent for embedding generation. This adjustment aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of handling large datasets within the component.

Additionally, internal calls to the AWS Bedrock service have been updated to explicitly encode request data, resolving deprecation warnings and ensuring continued compatibility with the AWS SDK. Further code adjustments were made to suppress specific deprecation warnings, and underlying dependencies, including AWS libraries, have been updated.
