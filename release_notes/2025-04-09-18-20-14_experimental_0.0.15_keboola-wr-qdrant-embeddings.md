## Change log (AI generated):
## Updated Embedding Component: Improved Compatibility and Processing
Our embedding component received updates for enhanced compatibility with AWS Bedrock and more robust data batching.

We've rolled out internal improvements to how embeddings are generated within the Keboola platform. These changes enhance the reliability and efficiency of the process, particularly when working with AWS Bedrock and handling large datasets.

For users leveraging AWS Bedrock for embeddings, we've updated the underlying API call parameter to align with the latest library requirements (specifically changing `texts` to `documents`). This ensures seamless communication with the Bedrock service, maintaining accurate and reliable embedding generation.

Additionally, we've refined the logic for batching input data before it's sent to various embedding providers. The new approach handles data streams and large inputs more effectively, optimizing resource usage and ensuring smooth processing without altering the final embedding results. These changes contribute to a more robust and efficient embedding generation experience across the platform.
