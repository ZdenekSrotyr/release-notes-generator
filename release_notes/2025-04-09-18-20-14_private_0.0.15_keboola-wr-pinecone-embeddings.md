## Change log (AI generated):
**Enhanced Bedrock Integration for Embeddings**

**Excerpt:** Bedrock embedding extraction is now more flexible, alongside refinements to batch processing and rate limiting.

**Post Detail:**
The component for extracting text embeddings using AWS Bedrock has been updated for broader model compatibility. It now correctly retrieves embedding vectors whether the Bedrock API response uses the key `embedding` (like Titan models) or `embeddings` (like Cohere models accessed via Bedrock), ensuring consistent data retrieval across different underlying models.

We've also refined how text data is processed in batches and how API rate limits are handled. The component now consistently uses the configured batch size for requests to the embedding API. Rate limiting is applied before each batch is sent, adjusting the timing of calls rather than the size of the batches themselves. This modifies the throttling behaviour when interacting with the embedding service.

Additionally, necessary API headers (`accept`, `contentType`) have been added to Bedrock requests to align with best practices and prevent warnings. Certain deprecation warnings in the logs have also been suppressed for a cleaner operational experience.
