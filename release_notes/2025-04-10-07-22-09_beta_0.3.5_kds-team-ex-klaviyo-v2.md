## Component Update: Internal Improvements and Stability Enhancements
This release focuses on internal updates to helper scripts and dependencies, with no changes to core data processing functionality.

We've released an update primarily focused on internal maintenance and stability. This version incorporates modifications to backend helper scripts (sync actions), updates PHP dependencies, and refines our CI/CD pipeline configurations.

Crucially, this update does not introduce any changes to the main Python data processing code. Your existing component configurations, workflows, and the core functionality you rely on remain completely unaffected. These internal adjustments help ensure the continued reliability and maintainability of the component behind the scenes.



## Changes:



- added autoload to sync actions 




- PR #3
