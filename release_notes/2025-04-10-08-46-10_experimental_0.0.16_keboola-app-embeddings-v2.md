## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component v2: Now Supports Pinecone Vector Database
Easily generate and store your text embeddings directly into Pinecone, alongside improvements to default text chunking.

We've updated the Embeddings Component v2 (keboola/component-embeddings-v2) to enhance its capabilities and flexibility.

The major enhancement in this release is the addition of support for the Pinecone vector database. You can now configure the component to write the generated embeddings and their associated metadata directly to your Pinecone instance, expanding your options for storing and querying vector data.

Additionally, we've adjusted the default setting for text chunk overlap from 0 to 200. This change aims to improve the quality of embeddings by ensuring better context preservation between adjacent text chunks, particularly for information located near chunk boundaries.

Finally, we have refactored the component's configuration structure for better organization while ensuring backward compatibility. Existing configurations will continue to work seamlessly without requiring manual changes.
