## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock New Vector Storage: Pinecone Integration & Processing Upgrades
Connect to Pinecone for vector storage and benefit from improved text chunking and Azure AI document parsing options.

We're excited to announce several enhancements to our data processing capabilities, expanding your options for storing and refining your data.

You can now seamlessly integrate with Pinecone as a vector store destination. This adds another powerful option for managing your generated embeddings, allowing you to choose the best fit for your vector database needs. Configuration is straightforward, letting you specify your Pinecone environment, index, and API key directly within the component setup.

Additionally, we've fine-tuned how text is prepared for embedding. The default overlap between text chunks has been increased to 200 characters, providing more context between adjacent segments when using the default text splitting settings. For those using Azure AI Document Intelligence, you now have the ability to select the specific model used for document parsing, giving you greater control over the quality and structure of extracted text. We've also improved backward compatibility, ensuring smoother processing by applying default settings if Azure Document Intelligence configurations are missing.
