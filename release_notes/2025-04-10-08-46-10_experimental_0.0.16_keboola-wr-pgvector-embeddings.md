#  keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings 0.0.16

_Released on 2025-04-10_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.16](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.16)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
**Title:** Embeddings Component: Now Supports Pinecone

**Excerpt:** Store your generated embeddings in either Pinecone or Qdrant vector stores.

**Post Detail:**
We've enhanced the Embeddings Generation component by adding Pinecone as a supported vector store destination. You can now choose to store your embeddings and associated metadata in either Qdrant (the previous default) or Pinecone, providing more flexibility for your vector database requirements.

Configuration for connecting to embedding models (OpenAI/Azure OpenAI) has been updated, now utilizing `model_provider` and `api_version` parameters. Note that the default embedding provider has been changed to Azure OpenAI, and its default API version is now `2024-03-01-preview`.

To ensure seamless operation, backward compatibility is included. Existing configurations using older parameters like `api_backend` will be automatically handled. Configurations previously set up for Pinecone without an explicit `vector_store` parameter will now correctly default to using Pinecone. Necessary dependencies, including the Pinecone client, have been added, and OpenAI/Qdrant clients updated.
