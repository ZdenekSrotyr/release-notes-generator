#  keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings 0.0.16

_Released on 2025-04-10_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.16](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.16)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Power Up Your Vector Search: Send Embeddings Directly to Pinecone
Our Embeddings component can now send generated embeddings directly to your Pinecone index, alongside other component improvements.

We're excited to announce a significant enhancement to our Embeddings component: you can now write generated embeddings directly to your Pinecone vector database. This integration streamlines workflows for AI applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and similarity search by sending vectors straight to where they're needed. Simply select 'pinecone' as the destination and provide your Pinecone credentials in the component configuration to leverage this new capability.

Alongside this major update, we've made a couple of other adjustments. The default name for the output column containing embeddings has changed from `embeddings` to `embedding`. Please check your downstream processes if you rely on the default column name, as this might require an update. Additionally, we've improved how the component selects a default embedding model if one isn't explicitly specified in your configuration, ensuring better backward compatibility and using the correct model names.
