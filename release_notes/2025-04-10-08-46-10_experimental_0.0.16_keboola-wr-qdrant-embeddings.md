**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component Now Supports Pinecone Destination
Easily send your generated text embeddings directly to a Pinecone index for seamless vector database integration.

The Embeddings Generation component (v2) has been updated to include Pinecone as a supported destination. You can now configure the component to write the generated embeddings directly into your specified Pinecone index, streamlining your workflows for building vector search and retrieval applications.

To use this new feature, select 'pinecone' as the destination type in your component configuration and provide the necessary Pinecone environment and API key details. We've updated the configuration structure to accommodate these new parameters and added validation to ensure they are correctly set up.

Additionally, please note that the default text chunking strategy has been set to `basic`. If you haven't explicitly configured a chunking strategy, your text might be processed differently than before. We've also improved backward compatibility to ensure configurations using older parameter structures are still handled correctly.
