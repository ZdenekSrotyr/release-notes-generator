**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.16](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.16)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Embeddings Component Now Supports Pinecone Destination

Excerpt: Store your generated text embeddings directly in a Pinecone vector index for seamless vector search integration.

Post detail:
We've enhanced the Embeddings component with a new destination option: Pinecone. You can now configure the component to write embedding vectors and their associated metadata directly into your specified Pinecone index, streamlining workflows for vector search use cases. Data is formatted and upserted in batches according to Pinecone's requirements.

To support this and future destination types, the internal data writing mechanism has been refactored using an abstraction layer. You can select either Keboola Storage Table (the default and existing behavior) or the new Pinecone destination during configuration. The functionality for the Keboola Storage destination remains unchanged.

Backward compatibility for older configuration structures has been added. The component automatically detects and maps parameters from previous versions, ensuring existing configurations continue to work without errors.

Additionally, the default batch size for sending texts to the embedding model API has been changed from 1000 to 500. This may slightly affect processing speed and API rate limit interactions. Users can still explicitly configure the batch size. A minor typo in parameter handling was also corrected.
