**Stage:** PRIVATE


## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Embeddings Component: Now Supports Pinecone Destination

Excerpt: Directly send generated text embeddings to your Pinecone vector database.

Post detail:
The Embeddings component has been updated to support Pinecone as a destination. You can now configure the component to send generated embeddings and associated metadata directly to a specified Pinecone index. Setup requires your Pinecone API key, environment, index name, and the expected dimension.

Additionally, the default value for the text chunk overlap (`chunk_overlap`) parameter has been changed from 50 to 0. This means that, by default, text chunks generated for embedding will no longer overlap unless you explicitly configure a different value. This may affect the resulting embeddings, particularly near chunk boundaries.

Backward compatibility has been implemented to ensure that older component configurations using a flat structure are automatically mapped to the new nested parameter format, allowing existing setups to function without modification.
