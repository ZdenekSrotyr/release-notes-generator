## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock Vector Search: Send Data Directly to Pinecone
Effortlessly send processed data, including embeddings and metadata, directly to your Pinecone vector database.

We've expanded our destination options by adding support for Pinecone.
You can now configure your workflows to send processed data, specifically embeddings and associated metadata, directly to a specified index within your Pinecone vector database. This integration streamlines the process of populating your vector database, enabling powerful vector search capabilities for applications like semantic search, recommendation engines, and other AI-driven features directly on your Keboola-processed data.
Data is efficiently upserted in batches. Simply configure the new Pinecone destination parameters in your component setup, including your API key, environment, and target index name, to start sending data.
