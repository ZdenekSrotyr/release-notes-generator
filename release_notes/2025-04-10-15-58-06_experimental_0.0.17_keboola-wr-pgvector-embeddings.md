**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock Vector Search with New Pinecone Destination
Introducing Pinecone as a new output destination, enabling direct data writes, including embeddings and metadata, to your vector indexes.

We're excited to announce a powerful new addition to our output destinations: Pinecone. You can now seamlessly send your data, particularly embedding vectors and associated metadata, directly to your Pinecone vector indexes.

This integration allows you to leverage Pinecone's capabilities for vector search and similarity applications. Our writer automatically processes your tabular data, extracting specified IDs, vector values, and metadata columns (prefixed with `__meta_`) before efficiently upserting them into your designated Pinecone index and namespace in optimized batches.

Configure your Pinecone connection details (API key, environment, index) within Keboola, and start populating your vector database directly from your data workflows. This unlocks new possibilities for building applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection on top of your Keboola-processed data.
