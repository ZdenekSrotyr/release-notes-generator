## Change log (AI generated):
New Destination: Send Embeddings Directly to Pinecone
Streamline your AI workflows by sending computed embeddings directly to your Pinecone vector database index.

We're excited to announce that you can now send embedding data directly to Pinecone! This update adds Pinecone as a supported destination within the component.

Simplify your AI and machine learning pipelines by pushing computed embeddings straight into your designated Pinecone index. This eliminates the need for extra steps or custom scripts, getting your vectors ready for similarity search and other AI-powered tasks faster.

Getting started is easy: just add your Pinecone API key, environment details, and target index name to the component's configuration to utilize this powerful new integration.
