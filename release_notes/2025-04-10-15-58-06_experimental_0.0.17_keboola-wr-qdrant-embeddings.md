**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.17](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.17)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## New Destination: Pinecone for Vector Embeddings
Store your generated embeddings directly into Pinecone for advanced similarity search and AI applications.

We're excited to announce a powerful new destination option: Pinecone. You can now send your generated vector embeddings and associated metadata directly from Keboola to your Pinecone vector database index.

This integration streamlines the process of building AI and machine learning applications. Instead of exporting embeddings to files and then loading them separately, you can now pipe them straight into Pinecone, making them immediately available for similarity searches, recommendation engines, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and other vector-based operations.

Configuration is straightforward within the component setup. Simply select Pinecone as the destination and provide your API key, environment, and target index name. Keboola handles connecting and efficiently upserting your vectors and metadata.

This new capability significantly accelerates the path from data processing in Keboola to leveraging powerful vector database features in Pinecone, empowering your AI/ML initiatives.
