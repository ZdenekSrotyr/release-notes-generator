## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock Vector Search: Send Embeddings to Pinecone
Seamlessly export your generated vector embeddings and associated metadata directly to a Pinecone index.

We're excited to announce a new capability that allows you to send generated vector embeddings directly to your Pinecone vector database. This integration streamlines the process of leveraging powerful vector search and similarity applications.

When processing data to generate embeddings, you can now configure Pinecone as an additional output destination. Alongside the standard Keboola output table, the component will automatically format and send the embeddings, corresponding vector IDs, and original text data to your specified Pinecone index in batches.

This feature enables you to easily populate your Pinecone database directly from your Keboola workflows, making your vectorized data ready for advanced analysis, recommendation engines, or semantic search implementations without extra steps. Simply select 'pinecone' as the database provider in the component configuration.

This update also includes internal enhancements, standardizing our approach to vector database integration, paving the way for more destinations in the future.
