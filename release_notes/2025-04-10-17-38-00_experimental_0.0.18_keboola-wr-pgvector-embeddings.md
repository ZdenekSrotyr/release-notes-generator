## Change log (AI generated):
## Send Your Embeddings Directly to Pinecone
Directly write your processed embedding vectors and metadata to a Pinecone vector database index.

Keboola now supports writing data directly to Pinecone, a leading vector database. This new functionality allows you to seamlessly send your processed embedding vectors, along with their associated metadata, straight into your specified Pinecone index.

By storing your embeddings in Pinecone, you can leverage its powerful capabilities for high-performance vector similarity searches. This unlocks new possibilities for applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and anomaly detection directly using data processed within Keboola. Simply configure your Pinecone connection details (API key, environment, index name) to start sending your embeddings.
