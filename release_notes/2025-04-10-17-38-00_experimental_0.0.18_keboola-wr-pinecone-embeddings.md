## Change log (AI generated):
## Pinecone Now Supported as Vector Store Destination
You can now write generated vector embeddings and metadata directly to your Pinecone indexes within Keboola.

Keboola now supports Pinecone as a destination for vector data. This integration allows you to seamlessly send generated embeddings and associated metadata directly from your Keboola workflows to your specified Pinecone vector indexes.

Streamline the process of populating your vector database for applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic search, and recommendation systems. Leverage Pinecone's specialized capabilities for managing and querying large-scale vector data without needing complex intermediate storage or manual upload steps.

Easily configure the Pinecone destination with your credentials, target index, and optional namespace. The component handles efficient batching of records and includes automatic retries to ensure reliable data delivery to the Pinecone API.
