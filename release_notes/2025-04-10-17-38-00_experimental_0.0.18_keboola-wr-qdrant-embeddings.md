## Change log (AI generated):
## Power Your Vector Search: Send Embeddings to Pinecone

Easily populate your Pinecone vector database with embeddings generated directly within Keboola.

We've enhanced our embedding generation component to support Pinecone as a direct data destination. You can now configure the component to write generated embeddings and their associated metadata straight into your specified Pinecone vector database index.

This update streamlines the process of preparing data for vector search, similarity analysis, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) use cases. The component handles formatting the data into Pinecone's required structure (vector ID, values, metadata) and efficiently upserts it in batches to your index.

To enable this, simply select Pinecone as the destination in the component configuration and provide your Pinecone API key, environment, and target index name. This functionality exists alongside the original option to write embeddings to a Keboola Storage Table.

Behind the scenes, we've also refactored the data writing process using a new abstraction layer. This standardizes how data is sent to different destinations (like Keboola Tables or Pinecone) and makes the component more flexible for future enhancements.
