**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.19](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.19)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced OpenAI Connection Testing

We've improved the reliability of the connection testing mechanism for the OpenAI component.

This update refines how the "Test Connection" functionality verifies your OpenAI API key. Previously, the key was directly assigned for testing. Now, we utilize a dedicated OpenAI client instance and perform a standard API call (`models.list`) to confirm connectivity and key validity before the component runs.

Error handling during this test phase has also been standardized to provide clearer feedback, specifically using `UserException` for authentication issues.

This change enhances the robustness of the initial connection validation step, ensuring your credentials are correct before initiating a job. Importantly, this modification only affects the connection testing process and does not alter the core logic for generating embeddings during component execution.
