_Released on 2025-04-15_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-pgvector-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.19](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.19)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Error Handling for OpenAI Components
Troubleshoot OpenAI connection or authentication problems more easily with improved, specific error messages.

We've refined the error handling within our OpenAI components to provide you with clearer feedback during the initial setup phase. Previously, connection or authentication issues might have resulted in a generic error message.

Now, the component specifically identifies and reports `APIConnectionError` and `AuthenticationError` exceptions from OpenAI. This means if there's an issue connecting to the API or authenticating your credentials, you'll receive a more informative message pinpointing the exact problem. This change helps you resolve setup issues faster and makes the component more robust by failing early and clearly when connection problems occur.

Importantly, this update does not affect the core data processing logic; embeddings generation and data handling remain unchanged once a successful connection is established.
