**Component:** [keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.19](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.19)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Refined Connection Test for Embedding Components
Improved initialization sequence enhances the reliability of the 'Test Connection' action for embedding components.

We've refined the 'Test Connection' action for embedding components to improve its reliability.

This update addresses the internal sequence for initializing the API client during the test. By ensuring the client is fully initialized before checking for available models, we prevent potential errors and provide a more robust validation process when you test your connection settings.

Rest assured, this enhancement only affects the 'Test Connection' button's behavior and does not change the core functionality or the way embeddings are generated during your data processing tasks.



## Changes:



- Fix test connection 




- PR #21
