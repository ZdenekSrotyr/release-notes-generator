**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced "Test Connection" Validates Embedding Model Access
Quickly verify your embedding model configuration with enhanced "Test Connection" validation.

We've enhanced the "Test Connection" functionality for embedding components. It now performs an additional check to validate access to the specific embedding model you've configured.

When you use "Test Connection", the component will now attempt to retrieve model information directly from the provider (e.g., OpenAI) using your provided API key and model ID.

This helps you catch configuration issues—such as invalid API keys, incorrect model IDs, or insufficient permissions—immediately during setup, preventing failures later during a full component run. This validation only occurs during the "Test Connection" action and does not change how embeddings are generated normally.



## Changes:



- Fix test connection
