## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Email SMTP Sender: Optionally Skip Attachments
Excerpt: The Email SMTP Sender component now lets you choose to send emails without attachments, providing greater flexibility and control.
Post detail:
We've enhanced the Email SMTP Sender component with a new capability: you can now optionally disable the inclusion of email attachments.

This update offers more precise control over your email dispatch. It's particularly useful when you need to send notifications or messages where attachments are unnecessary, or to potentially streamline the sending process by excluding files.

To use this feature, you'll find a new "Disable Attachments" parameter within the advanced section of the component's configuration. By default, this option is set to `false`, ensuring that attachments are processed and included as they always have been. If you set this parameter to `true`, the component will bypass all attachment handling, and no files from your `in/files` directory will be included in the outgoing email.

This new setting allows for more tailored email communications directly from your Keboola workflows.



## Changes:



- added option to disable attachments in advanced mode
