## Change log (AI generated):
## Update to Snowflake Key-Pair Authentication Logic
Snowflake key-pair authentication now requires distinct `private_key` and `public_key_fingerprint` parameters for a more explicit and reliable connection setup.

We've refined the logic for Snowflake key-pair authentication to enhance clarity and ensure robust connections. The platform now specifically checks for the presence of both `private_key` and `public_key_fingerprint` in your database configuration when establishing a Snowflake session using key-pair authentication.

This update makes the key-pair authentication setup more explicit and aligns it with standard Snowflake connector parameters. If your current configuration relied on a more generic `key_pair` field and did not provide these two distinct parameters, your Snowflake connections using key-pair authentication may fail. Please review and update your Snowflake database configurations to include separate `private_key` and `public_key_fingerprint` strings if you use key-pair authentication. Configurations already employing these separate parameters, or those using password-based authentication, are not affected by this change.

Additionally, this release includes internal refactoring of table name resolution logic for improved code organization. This structural enhancement does not alter data processing behavior or outcomes.
