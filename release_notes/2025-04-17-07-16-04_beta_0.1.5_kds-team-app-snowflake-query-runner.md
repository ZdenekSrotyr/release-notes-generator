## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Snowflake Component: Now with Password Authentication!
Excerpt: Our Snowflake component now supports password-based authentication, offering you more flexibility in how you connect.
Post Detail:
We've updated our Snowflake component to give you more options when connecting to your data warehouse. You can now use password-based authentication in addition to the existing key-pair method.

The component will now use the following logic for authentication:
- If a private key is provided in your configuration, key-pair authentication will be attempted.
- If a private key is not provided, the component will use the specified password for authentication.
- Please ensure that either a password or a private key is specified. An error will occur if connection details for neither method are found.

This enhancement offers greater flexibility, allowing you to choose the Snowflake authentication method that best fits your setup and security requirements without being restricted to key-pair authentication.



## Changes:



- fix of creating snowflake session without key-pair 




- remove of repeated code 




- PR #6
