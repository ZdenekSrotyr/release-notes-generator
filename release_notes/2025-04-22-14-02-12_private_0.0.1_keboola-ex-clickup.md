## Change log (AI generated):
Initial Python Component Framework Deployed
The first version (v0.0.1) of a new Python component is now available, establishing its core structure and performing initial configuration validation.

We've deployed the initial version (0.0.1) of a new Python component, laying the foundational groundwork for its future capabilities. This release focuses on establishing the component's core structure and ensuring basic configuration integrity.

In its current state, the component primarily validates your setup. The main logic in `src/component.py` checks for the presence of a required API token (`#api_token`) in the configuration. If this token is not provided, the component will alert you with a UserException.

Please note that data processing functionalities are not yet operational in this version. While the `Extractor` class in `src/extractor.py` is included, its `extract_data` method is a stub and will not fetch any data. Similarly, code sections responsible for fetching data from external sources and writing to output tables are currently inactive or commented out. As a result, this version does not perform any data extraction, transformation, or output.

Additionally, placeholder modules like `src/config.py` and `src/configuration/user_action.py` have been added. These modules set up a structural convention for future development but do not contain active logic at this stage.

This initial release (v0.0.1) serves as a non-operational stub regarding data processing, focusing solely on configuration validation and logging a completion message. It successfully prepares the component for the full data integration features planned in subsequent updates.
