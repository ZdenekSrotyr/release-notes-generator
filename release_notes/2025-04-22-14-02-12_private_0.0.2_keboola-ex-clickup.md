New ClickUp Extractor: Unlock Your Project Data
Our new ClickUp Extractor automates data retrieval from the ClickUp API, making it easy to integrate your project management data into Keboola.

We're excited to launch the new ClickUp Extractor, designed to help you seamlessly pull data from your ClickUp workspace directly into the Keboola platform. This powerful component automates the extraction process, enabling you to integrate your project management information for comprehensive analysis and reporting.

Key capabilities of the new ClickUp Extractor include:
-   **Flexible Data Retrieval:** Specify the exact ClickUp API endpoints you want to query, pass custom parameters, and choose to extract specific data fields or the entire API response.
-   **Configurable Extraction Items:** Define multiple "items to export," each with its own set of parameters, allowing you to tailor data extraction to your precise needs for various ClickUp resources.
-   **Automated CSV Output:** Extracted data is automatically formatted and written into CSV files within your `out/tables/` directory, ready for use in Keboola Storage.
-   **Table Manifests with Primary Keys:** Corresponding manifest files are generated for each output table, including primary key information if specified, ensuring data integrity and ease of use downstream.
-   **Secure API Authentication:** The extractor uses your ClickUp API token for secure access to your data.

With the ClickUp Extractor, you can now easily centralize your ClickUp data alongside other business sources in Keboola, simplifying your data workflows and empowering you to gain deeper insights from your project activities.
