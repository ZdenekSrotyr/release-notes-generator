## Change log (AI generated):
## New Actions for Enhanced Component Testing & State Inspection
We've introduced two new synchronous actions to streamline component development and debugging, alongside improved logging for state files.

These updates provide developers with more direct ways to test output generation and inspect component state, making it easier to build and troubleshoot Keboola components.

The first new synchronous action, `table_output_test`, allows you to generate a sample table output on demand. When invoked, it creates a `table_output.csv` file in your component's output directory, populated with a predefined schema (`id`, `value`) and sample data. This is invaluable for quickly verifying your component's ability to produce structured CSV outputs.

The second action, `show_state_test`, provides a simple way to view the current state file. It reads the `state.json` written during a standard run and outputs its content as a JSON object to standard output. This offers immediate insight into your component's persisted state, aiding in debugging and understanding state transitions.

Additionally, we've enhanced the standard component run. Now, after the `state.json` file is written, its content is automatically read and printed to the standard output. This provides greater visibility into the component's state during regular execution, simplifying logging and debugging without requiring manual file inspection.
