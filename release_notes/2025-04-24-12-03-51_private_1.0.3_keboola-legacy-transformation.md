## Change log (AI generated):
## Fine-Tune Transformation Performance with Backend Sizing
Legacy transformations now support backend sizing, allowing you to influence workspace resources and select specific Snowflake warehouse sizes for optimized data processing.

We've updated our legacy transformation component to give you more control over the resources used during your data processing tasks. You can now specify a `backend_size` parameter in your job configuration.

This new `backend_size` setting directly impacts how your transformations run:
*   **Workspace Allocation:** When a temporary backend workspace is created for your transformation, the specified `backend_size` will be used, potentially altering the computational power and memory available. This can lead to changes in processing speed and capacity.
*   **Snowflake Warehouse Selection:** For transformations running on Snowflake, the `backend_size` parameter will now determine the specific Snowflake virtual warehouse (e.g., XSMALL, SMALL, MEDIUM) used for executing your SQL queries. This allows for more precise management of Snowflake resources, affecting query performance and costs.

By leveraging the `backend_size` parameter, you can better tailor the transformation environment to your specific needs, potentially improving performance and managing costs more effectively.
