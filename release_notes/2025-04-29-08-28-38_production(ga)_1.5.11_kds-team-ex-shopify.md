## Deeper Shopify Insights: Payments Transactions Now Available

Our Shopify extractor now captures Payments Transactions data, alongside enhanced security and connection stability for more reliable data integration.

We're excited to announce a significant update to our Shopify extractor: you can now fetch and process **Payments Transactions** data. This new capability allows you to gain a more comprehensive view of your Shopify store's financial performance by incorporating detailed transaction information directly into your Keboola projects.

To complement this, we've also made key improvements to the extractor's security and reliability:

*   **Enhanced Connection Security:** SSL certificate verification is now strictly enforced for all API calls to Shopify. This upgrade ensures that your data is transmitted securely. Please note, this means data retrieval will now fail if a Shopify store's SSL certificate is invalid, preventing connections to potentially insecure endpoints.
*   **Improved Stability:** We've added more robust error handling during the setup of the Shopify API client. This makes the extractor more resilient, ensuring smoother data acquisition even if initial connection issues arise.
*   **Better Observability:** For the new Payments Transactions stream, we've incorporated detailed logging for batch processing, aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting.

These updates expand the data you can work with from Shopify and ensure that the process is more secure and dependable.
