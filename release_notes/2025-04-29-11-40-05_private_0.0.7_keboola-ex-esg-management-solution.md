## Change log (AI generated):
Title: ESG Extractor Update: Stricter Service Validation & Enhanced Reliability
Excerpt: The ESG Extractor now features improved validation for service types (e.g., activities, reviews) and internal enhancements for greater robustness.
Post Detail:
We've updated the ESG Extractor with a focus on improving data integrity and overall component stability.

Here’s what’s new:
*   **Enhanced Service Validation:** The extractor now validates the requested service (like "activities", "reviews", or "messages") against a predefined list. This ensures that only supported services are processed, providing clearer error messages for invalid configurations and preventing unexpected issues during data extraction.
*   **Consistent Output Naming:** Output CSV files, such as `activities.csv` or `reviews.csv`, are now named more systematically based on the validated service, leading to more predictable output.
*   **Robust API Interaction:** Communication with the underlying API is now more standardized, strengthening the reliability of data retrieval.

Alongside these functional improvements, we've made significant internal changes, including renaming the core processing class to `ESGExtractor` and restructuring the component's codebase. These under-the-hood enhancements improve maintainability and pave the way for future developments, ensuring the ESG Extractor remains a reliable tool.
