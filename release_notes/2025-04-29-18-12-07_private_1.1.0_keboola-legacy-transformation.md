## Change log (AI generated):
## Fine-Tune Snowflake Transformations with Backend Size Control
Optimize your Snowflake transformation jobs by specifying the backend warehouse size for better performance and cost management.

We're excited to announce a new enhancement for Snowflake transformations: you can now specify the backend warehouse size directly within your job configuration.

This update gives you precise control over the computational resources allocated to your Snowflake transformation tasks. By selecting a specific backend size (e.g., `X-SMALL`, `SMALL`, `MEDIUM`), you can better manage processing performance and associated costs. This is especially useful for optimizing resource-intensive operations or controlling expenses for less demanding jobs. While your core transformation logic, such as SQL queries or scripts, remains unchanged, this feature directly influences how efficiently your data is processed in Snowflake, particularly when handling large datasets.

## Enhanced Job Management for Transformations
We've upgraded the underlying client for submitting transformation jobs, paving the way for new functionalities and bolstering overall reliability.

To ensure our transformation components operate smoothly and support future enhancements, we have integrated an updated version of the Keboola Job Queue Client.

This behind-the-scenes improvement modifies how our transformation components interact with the job submission system. It's a key enabler for new capabilities, such as the recently introduced backend size configuration for Snowflake transformations. Furthermore, this update helps ensure more stable and reliable job submissions and management by incorporating the latest improvements from the client library.
