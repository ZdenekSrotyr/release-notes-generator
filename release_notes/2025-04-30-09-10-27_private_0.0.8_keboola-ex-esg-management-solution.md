## Change log (AI generated):
## Introducing Template-Driven Data Extraction
Gain greater flexibility and control over data extraction with our new template-based system.

We're excited to announce a significant enhancement to our data extraction capabilities: the introduction of a template-based system. This means the logic determining what data to extract and how it's structured is now driven by external templates, rather than being solely hardcoded.
This fundamental change offers much greater flexibility and configurability, allowing you to tailor data extraction processes precisely to your diverse needs and data sources.

## Enhanced API Connectivity with New Common Client
Experience more reliable and robust data fetching and submission thanks to our new common client module for API interactions.

We've rolled out a new common client module, designed to improve how our platform interacts with external APIs. This upgrade refines data fetching and submission processes, potentially including better request formation, more robust response parsing, and improved error handling for API communications.
You can expect more stable and dependable data operations when our components connect to external services.

## Component Upgrades: Refined Code for Better Data Processing
Our components have undergone internal cleanup and refactoring, leading to more efficient and reliable data handling.

We've recently completed a series of cleanup and refactoring efforts within our component codebase. These internal improvements are focused on optimizing data processing logic, such as data transformations, validation rules, or filtering criteria.
While these changes are under the hood, they contribute directly to more robust, reliable, and efficient data handling outcomes within the platform.

## Modernized Component Architecture for Enhanced Performance
A major restructuring of our component codebase paves the way for improved scalability, maintainability, and faster future innovation.

Our component infrastructure has undergone a significant restructuring, often referred to as a "component split." This involved reorganizing our codebase into smaller, more focused modules, modernizing the underlying architecture.
This foundational work not only improves current system stability and performance but also enhances our ability to develop and deliver new features and improvements more rapidly.
