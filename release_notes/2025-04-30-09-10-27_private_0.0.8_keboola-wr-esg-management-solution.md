## Power Up Your ESG Data: Enhanced Resilience & Custom Endpoint Options
Extract ESG data more reliably and with greater precision, thanks to an updated API client and configurable data sources in our ESG component.

Our ESG component has been updated to provide you with more robust data extraction and greater control over the information you gather.

We've significantly improved the API client's retry mechanism. It now makes more attempts to fetch data in case of transient API issues, using a more resilient strategy. This means a higher success rate for your data extractions, leading to more complete datasets even when facing temporary service interruptions from the sustainability API.

Additionally, you now have the power to customize exactly what data is extracted. The component can load its API endpoint definitions from a local file or a Git repository, specified in your configuration. While a comprehensive default set of endpoints is included, this new flexibility allows you to provide your own `endpoints.json` file. This means you can add new data sources, remove unneeded ones, or modify existing API calls to perfectly tailor the data extraction scope to your specific ESG reporting and analysis needs.

These enhancements, part of a broader refinement of the component's codebase, aim to make your ESG data integration smoother, more reliable, and highly adaptable.
