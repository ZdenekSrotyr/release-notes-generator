_Released on 2025-04-30_

**Component:** [kds-team.ex-kbc-project-metadata-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-kbc-project-metadata-v2)  
**Tag:** [2.3.4](https://github.com/keboola/component-kbc-project-metadata-v2/releases/tag/2.3.4)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
Enhanced Event ID Control & Log Standardization in Project Metadata
Updates to the Project Metadata component offer greater flexibility in event ID generation and improve consistency for internal log messages.
We've enhanced the Project Metadata component (keboola/component-kbc-project-metadata-v2) with new capabilities for managing event identifiers.

A new `force_uuid` option allows for the explicit regeneration of event IDs as UUIDs, even if an event already has an existing ID. This provides finer-grained control, useful in scenarios where unique, system-generated IDs are strictly required for all logged events or manifest entries.

Additionally, internal log messages related to manifest uploads, such as "Table manifest uploaded" or "File manifest uploaded," will now consistently feature newly generated UUIDs as their event IDs. This change standardizes these specific log event identifiers, simplifying debugging and auditing processes by ensuring a unique ID for each such internal logging event.

More Reliable Event Data Retrieval for Project Metadata
The Project Metadata component now retrieves event data more reliably, thanks to a fix addressing potential hangs during the process.
We've resolved an issue within the Project Metadata component (keboola/component-kbc-project-metadata-v2) that could cause it to hang indefinitely while fetching event data from the Storage API.

The bug, related to pagination logic when listing events, has been corrected. The component now properly increments its offset based on newly fetched events and includes a crucial break condition if the API returns an empty list of new events. This fix significantly enhances the reliability of event data collection, ensuring that the component completes its processing and handles situations with empty data pages gracefully.
