## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock Your MotherDuck Data: New Keboola Connector Now Available
Our new Keboola connector allows you to directly query MotherDuck and seamlessly integrate the results into your Keboola projects.

We're thrilled to introduce a powerful new way to work with your data: the Keboola MotherDuck Connector! This component enables you to establish a direct connection to your MotherDuck instance, execute your custom SQL queries, fetch the results, and write the data directly into your Keboola output tables. This provides a streamlined path for integrating MotherDuck data into your broader Keboola workflows.

To enhance the intelligence and robustness of your data operations, the connector now also loads crucial metadata (like schemas and data types) from your Keboola input tables via the Storage API. This allows for more precise query validation, dynamic query building based on your existing table structures, and ensures accurate data typing in your outputs, making your data processing both powerful and context-aware.

Beyond these core capabilities, this release focuses on providing a stable and user-friendly experience. We've implemented comprehensive error handling to manage unexpected issues gracefully during data processing. Output data artifacts are now named and tagged consistently within Keboola Storage for easier identification and management. Additionally, refinements to how metadata is handled for UI configuration actions mean a smoother setup process. These improvements, coupled with various bug fixes, ensure reliable and accurate data processing from MotherDuck to Keboola.
