Title: New MotherDuck Connector: Query Your Data & Load to Keboola
Excerpt: Our new MotherDuck connector enables you to execute SQL queries against your MotherDuck instance and load the results directly into Keboola Storage.
Post Detail:
We're excited to introduce the new MotherDuck Connector, designed to seamlessly integrate your MotherDuck data into the Keboola platform! This powerful connector allows you to connect directly to your MotherDuck instance, execute custom SQL queries, and load the results into Keboola Storage.

Key features and improvements include:
*   **Direct MotherDuck Querying:** Connect securely using your `motherduck_token` and run any SQL query to extract the exact data you need from your MotherDuck databases.
*   **Automated Output to Keboola Storage:** Query results are automatically written as CSV files into your Keboola output tables, complete with manifest files, making them instantly available for your downstream data pipelines.
*   **Simplified Configuration with Metadata:** To streamline setup, the connector can fetch metadata directly from MotherDuckâ€”such as lists of available databases, tables, and their column details. This assists you in configuring your queries through the user interface.
*   **Enhanced Reliability:** We've improved connection management and error handling. If a SQL query encounters an issue, you'll receive a clear error message, and the process will stop cleanly to prevent incomplete data loads. Metadata retrieval for UI assistance is also more resilient.

This new connector empowers you to easily leverage your MotherDuck data within your Keboola projects.

Additionally, this update includes a new synchronous action to retrieve structural metadata (column names, types, primary keys) for your existing Keboola Storage tables, aiding in your overall data management tasks.
