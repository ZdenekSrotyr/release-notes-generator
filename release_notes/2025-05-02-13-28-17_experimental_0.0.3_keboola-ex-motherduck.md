## Change log (AI generated):
## Streamlined Data Imports: Decimal Values Now Floats
For enhanced consistency, decimal values from your CSV imports are now automatically converted to float data types.

We've updated our CSV data import process: `decimal.Decimal` values are now automatically converted into standard `float` types. This change is effective immediately.

This enhancement standardizes numeric data representation in Keboola. It promotes greater consistency across your projects and improves compatibility with various data tools and destinations, such as MotherDuck. By converting these values to floats, we simplify data type management and help prevent potential conflicts in your data pipelines.

Please be aware that while this automatic conversion leads to smoother data operations, the transition from `decimal.Decimal` to `float` can occasionally result in a minor loss of precision for numbers that cannot be perfectly represented in binary floating-point format. This update is designed to make numeric data handling more robust and predictable.
