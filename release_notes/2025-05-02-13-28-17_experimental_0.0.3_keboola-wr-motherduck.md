## Change log (AI generated):
Title: MotherDuck Component: Consistent String Representation for Null Columns
Excerpt: The MotherDuck component now more reliably converts untyped columns containing only null values to strings, enhancing data consistency.
Post Detail:
We've updated the MotherDuck component to improve how it handles data types, specifically for untyped columns that consist entirely of null or missing values.

Previously, these columns were directly converted to the string data type. With this enhancement, such columns are now first explicitly cast to an `object` data type before their final conversion to string. This two-step process ensures a more robust and consistent string representation of these nulls (such as "nan", "<NA>", or "None"), resolving potential inconsistencies or errors that might have occurred with direct casting. This leads to more predictable data outputs when working with columns that exclusively contain missing values in your MotherDuck projects.
