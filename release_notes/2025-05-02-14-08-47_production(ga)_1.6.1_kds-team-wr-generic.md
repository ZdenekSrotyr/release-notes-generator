## Change log (AI generated):
## Generic Extractor: Unlock More APIs with Enhanced Security & Reliability
Our Generic Extractor (`keboola/component-generic`) now supports new authentication methods, mTLS, and improved request handling, enabling connections to a wider range of APIs more reliably and securely.

The latest update to our Generic Extractor significantly expands its capabilities, making it easier and more secure to fetch data from a diverse set of APIs. These enhancements focus on broadening connectivity options and ensuring the integrity of your data pipelines.

Key Enhancements Include:

*   **Broader API Authentication Support:** Connect to more services than ever before. We've added support for several new authentication methods, including 'ApiKey', 'Login', 'OAuth2 Basic', and 'OAuth2 POST'. This means you can now access data sources that rely on these common authentication schemes.
*   **Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Enhanced Security:** For APIs requiring a higher level of security, the extractor now supports mTLS. You can configure client-side SSL/TLS certificates for mutual authentication, enabling secure data extraction from enterprise-grade or highly sensitive APIs.
*   **More Reliable API Interactions:** We've made several improvements to how API requests are constructed and handled. This includes corrections to URL building, ensuring query parameters in 'Login' authentication are processed correctly, and fixing issues with JSON payload construction for POST requests. These changes lead to more accurate data retrieval and fewer connection errors.
*   **Consistent Request Parameterization:** User-defined parameters are now substituted more uniformly across URLs, headers, and request bodies. This ensures your dynamic configurations are applied reliably, giving you precise control over the data you fetch.

These updates, along with internal refactoring and code improvements, make the Generic Extractor a more robust and versatile tool for your data integration needs.
