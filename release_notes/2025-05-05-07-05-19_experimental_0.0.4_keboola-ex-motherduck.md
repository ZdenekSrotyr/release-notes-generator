## Change log (AI generated):
Title: MotherDuck Component Enhanced with Table Processing Time Logs
Excerpt: The MotherDuck component now logs individual table processing times for better performance insights, alongside internal data loading refinements.
Post detail:
We've rolled out an update to our MotherDuck component (version 0.0.4), bringing enhancements for better performance tracking and internal processing efficiency.

Here's what's new and improved:
*   **Table Execution Time Logging:** To help you better understand and monitor the performance of your data loads, the component now measures and logs the time taken to process each individual table. These execution times are available in the debug logs, providing valuable insights for troubleshooting or optimizing your workflows.

*   **Data Insertion Query Refinement:** We've updated the internal SQL query used for inserting data from CSV files into MotherDuck tables. This change utilizes a more concise syntax (`INSERT INTO ... FROM read_csv_auto(...)` as a shorthand for `INSERT INTO ... SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto(...)`). This is a technical refinement and is functionally equivalent to the previous method. Crucially, this means **no change to your data's content, row order, or column mapping.** The order of rows remains determined by their sequence in the source CSV file, consistent with previous behavior. This internal adjustment clarifies data handling logic within the component.

These updates are part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the reliability and observability of the MotherDuck component.



## Changes:



- removed insertion order, fix description in ui, added execution time to debug logging
