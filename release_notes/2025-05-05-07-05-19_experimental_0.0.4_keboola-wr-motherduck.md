## Change log (AI generated):
## MotherDuck Component Refined: Simplified Configuration and Performance Logging
Our MotherDuck component is now simpler to configure and provides new insights into query performance with execution time logging.

We've updated the MotherDuck component (version `0.0.4`) with a couple of changes aimed at streamlining its use and enhancing observability.

First, we've removed the `insertion_order` configuration option. Our analysis showed this option was not actively influencing data loading or SQL query behavior in previous versions. Its removal simplifies the component's configuration without any impact on your data processing routines or a_nal output, as the system's behavior remains consistent with when this flag was effectively ignored.

Second, for better performance analysis and troubleshooting, we've added query execution timing. The component now measures how long each query takes to run and logs this duration at the DEBUG level. This enhancement provides valuable insights into query performance, helping to identify potential bottlenecks, but does not alter the data processed or the results.



## Changes:



- removed insertion order, fix description in ui, added execution time to debug logging
