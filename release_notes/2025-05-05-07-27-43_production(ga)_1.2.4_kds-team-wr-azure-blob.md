## Change log (AI generated):
Azure Blob Storage: Pinpoint Connection Errors Faster
Our Azure Blob Storage component now offers more detailed error messages during account validation, simplifying troubleshooting for connection issues.

We've enhanced the Azure Blob Storage component to make troubleshooting connection issues easier and more efficient.

When setting up your Azure Blob Storage connection, if something isn't quite right – such as invalid credentials or a network problem – the component will now provide much clearer and more detailed error messages. This means you'll get more specific information directly from Azure about what went wrong during the account validation phase.

This improvement helps you quickly pinpoint the cause of connection failures, saving you time and effort in diagnosing configuration problems. By catching these issues early with better feedback, you can ensure your data processing runs smoothly and avoid unexpected outcomes from misconfigured connections.
