## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced BigQuery View Management: Control Updates & Schema
Gain precise control over how existing BigQuery views are updated, now with in-place schema modifications or optional full recreation.

We're introducing more flexibility when working with existing BigQuery views. You now have greater control over how changes to your view definitions are applied.
A new configuration option, `delete_destination_view` (defaulting to `False`), allows you to choose the update strategy:
- **In-place Updates (Default):** When `delete_destination_view` is `False`, the component will attempt to update the existing view. This process now includes updates to the view's `schema` (like column types, modes, or descriptions) alongside the `view_query`. Previously, only the query was modified for existing views.
- **Recreate View:** If you set `delete_destination_view` to `True`, the component will first delete the existing view and then create a new one based on your configuration. This ensures the new definition is fully applied without any constraints from the previous version.
This enhancement allows for schema evolution of your views without losing the existing view object, subject to BigQuery's limitations on in-place schema modifications, giving you clearer control over your view definitions.

## Richer BigQuery Views: Now with Column Descriptions
Enhance your BigQuery views by adding descriptive metadata to columns, improving data discoverability directly within BigQuery.

You can now add descriptions to the columns of the BigQuery views created or updated by our component. This enhances the metadata of your views, making them easier to understand.
Simply include a `description` for each field in your input schema configuration. These descriptions will be populated in BigQuery when the view is created or updated.
This feature improves data discoverability and understanding directly within the BigQuery interface, providing valuable context for anyone using the views. Note that this modifies the view's structural definition, not the data values returned by the view.

## BigQuery Client Update: Location Now Auto-Determined
We've refined our BigQuery client initialization, removing the explicit `location` parameter to leverage BigQuery's default region detection.

We've made an update to how our BigQuery client initializes its connection. The explicit `location` parameter has been removed from the client's configuration.
The Google Cloud BigQuery client library will now automatically determine the operational region based on your project defaults, the dataset's location (as views are tied to dataset locations), or other implicit configurations.
This change primarily affects the context for Data Definition Language (DDL) operations, such as where the view is created or managed. If the component's previous explicit `location` setting influenced the region in a way that differs from the new implicit behavior, the effective region for these operations might change. Data content itself is not directly affected by this change.
