## Enhanced MotherDuck Integration: Robust Connectivity & Data Accuracy
We've launched a new MotherDuck client for seamless connections, alongside key improvements to table schema creation and query parameter handling for greater data reliability.

We're excited to introduce significant enhancements to our MotherDuck integration! A new, dedicated `DuckDBClient` now manages all connections and SQL query executions with MotherDuck, utilizing your service token for authentication. This provides a standardized and robust mechanism for all database interactions, including DDL for creating tables and DML for loading or transforming data.

Alongside this new client, we've refined our table schema definition and creation logic. This results in more accurate column data type mapping and correctly structured tables in MotherDuck, ensuring your data is stored as intended. Additionally, a critical fix in how table parameters are handled in SQL queries ensures that operations like `CREATE TABLE` or data loading reliably target the intended tables and schemas. These improvements work together to boost the accuracy and dependability of your data processing workflows with MotherDuck.

## New: Instantly Test Your MotherDuck Connection!
Easily verify your MotherDuck setup with our new "Test Connection" feature, ensuring your credentials and connectivity are correct before running pipelines.

We've added a handy "Test Connection" feature to our MotherDuck integration!
You can now quickly verify that your configured credentials are valid and that a connection to your MotherDuck instance can be successfully established. This simple check performs a lightweight operation, like executing `SELECT 1`, to confirm accessibility.
This helps you proactively identify and resolve any setup issues, giving you confidence that your data pipelines are ready to run smoothly from the get-go.
