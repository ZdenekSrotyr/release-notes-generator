## MotherDuck Integration Lands with Test Connection & Enhanced Stability

Easily connect to MotherDuck with our new dedicated client, now featuring a 'test connection' capability and more robust table creation for improved reliability.

We're excited to announce the introduction of native support for MotherDuck! This update includes a new, dedicated MotherDuck client, making it straightforward to manage connections and execute queries. A key addition is the "test connection" feature, allowing you to quickly verify your credentials and connectivity by performing a simple query against your MotherDuck instance. This ensures your setup is correct before running any data operations.

Alongside this new integration, we've significantly refactored how table schemas are defined and how tables are created in MotherDuck. These changes improve the accuracy of data type mapping and the overall reliability of DDL operations. We've also corrected a table-related parameter, fixing potential bugs that could lead to operations failing or data being written to incorrect locations. These enhancements, coupled with general code improvements, ensure greater stability and data integrity when working with MotherDuck.



## Changes:



- created duck client, added test connection button 




- refactor return_columns_data and create_db_table 




- docu 




- fix table param
