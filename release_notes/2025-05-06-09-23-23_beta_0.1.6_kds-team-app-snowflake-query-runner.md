## Change log (AI generated):
Enhanced Snowflake Key-Pair Authentication
We've improved the handling of private key passphrases for Snowflake key-pair authentication, leading to more reliable connections and clearer error diagnostics.

We've refined how our platform manages private key passphrases for Snowflake key-pair authentication, enhancing the stability and predictability of your connections.

Previously, if a passphrase was not provided or was left empty in your configuration for key-pair authentication, it was treated as an empty byte string. With this update, an absent or empty passphrase is now correctly interpreted as `None` during the private key loading process.

This change directly improves your experience:
- For private keys not protected by a passphrase, connections will now be more reliable as `None` is the appropriate value for handling such keys.
- If a passphrase-protected key is used without a supplied passphrase, the system will now provide more accurate failure feedback, making it easier to identify and resolve configuration issues.

This enhancement ensures a more robust connection process to Snowflake, allowing for smoother data operations.
