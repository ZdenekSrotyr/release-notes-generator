#  kds-team.wr-generic 1.6.2

_Released on 2025-05-06_

**Component:** [kds-team.wr-generic](https://github.com/keboola/component-generic)  
**Tag:** [1.6.2](https://github.com/keboola/component-generic/releases/tag/1.6.2)  
**Stage:** PRODUCTION(GA)


## Change log (AI generated):
## SSH Public Key Update: File Path Now Mandatory
The `public_key` parameter for SSH configurations now exclusively requires a file path, changing how public keys are processed and potentially impacting existing setups.

We've updated how SSH public keys are handled in your configurations. The `public_key` parameter, previously flexible in accepting either a direct key string or a file path, will now strictly interpret the value as a file path.

What this means for you:
If your component configurations previously had the literal SSH public key string directly in the `public_key` parameter, these components will now encounter an error. The system will attempt to treat that string as a filename, which will likely fail. This change can prevent the component from establishing necessary SSH connections, halting any data processing tasks dependent on them.

To ensure smooth operation, please verify your configurations. If you were providing the public key as a string, you'll need to save that key into a file and update the `public_key` parameter to point to the path of this new file. This change standardizes how SSH keys are managed, aiming for clearer and more consistent configuration practices.

## SSH Key File Errors: Updated Reporting Behavior
We've adjusted error handling for SSH key file reading; this may alter error messages if key files are missing or inaccessible, potentially affecting troubleshooting.

We have made a subtle change to the error handling mechanism when reading SSH key files, such as those specified by the `private_key` parameter. While this internal adjustment aims for robustness, it's important to be aware that it might alter the error messages you encounter in specific situations involving inaccessible key files.

Previously, if an SSH key file was missing or could not be accessed, you would typically receive a direct error like a `FileNotFoundError`. With the recent update, if the system fails to open the specified key file, a subsequent internal step might now raise a `NameError`. This new `NameError` could potentially mask the original, more informative file access issue, making it initially less clear why the component failed.

This change primarily affects how failures are reported when processing SSH key configuration data. If a component fails and you encounter an unexpected `NameError` related to SSH key configurations, this updated behavior might be the cause. We are sharing this information to assist in troubleshooting should you encounter such scenarios, particularly when key files are missing or permissions are incorrect.
