## Change log (AI generated):
## Python Components: Enhanced Environment & Dependency Management
We've upgraded how Python components manage their execution environments and dependencies, leading to more stable and consistent data processing for your projects.

This update focuses on improving the underlying infrastructure for Python components within Keboola. We've transitioned to a more modern and standardized method for creating Python virtual environments and installing necessary packages. Specifically, components now utilize `uv venv` for environment creation and `uv pip sync` for synchronizing dependencies directly from the `pyproject.toml` file.

The primary benefit of this change is a more robust and reliable Python execution environment. By ensuring better isolation and stricter adherence to specified dependency versions, we minimize potential discrepancies that could arise from system-level packages or less precise installation methods. This leads to more predictable behavior and dependable outcomes for your data processing tasks that rely on Python components. While the core logic of your component configurations remains the same, this foundational improvement contributes to overall platform stability and the consistency of your Python-based workflows.
