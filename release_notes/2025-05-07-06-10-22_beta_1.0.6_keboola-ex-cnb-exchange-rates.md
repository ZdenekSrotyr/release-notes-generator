## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced CNB Extractor: Skips Days with "Chyba serveru"
The Czech National Bank (CNB) exchange rate extractor now intelligently skips processing for days when the CNB API reports a "Chyba serveru" (Server error), ensuring higher data quality.

We've updated our Czech National Bank (CNB) exchange rate extractor to more robustly handle specific API responses. Previously, the CNB API would sometimes return a "Chyba serveru" (Czech for "Server error") message within a successful (200 OK) HTTP response. This could lead to attempts to parse erroneous data, potentially causing errors or ingesting no/incorrect exchange rates for that specific day.

With this enhancement, the component now actively checks the API response text for the "Chyba serveru" string. If this specific error message is detected for a given day:
*   The extractor will skip the data parsing step for that day's exchange rates.
*   A warning will be logged, notifying you that the CNB returned a server error for that date.
*   Consequently, no data rows for that affected date will be written to your output table, and the table manifest will not be updated based on this skipped attempt.

This improvement ensures cleaner data output by preventing the processing of known error responses, making your CNB exchange rate data more reliable.



## Changes:



- parse only when not chyba serveru, write manifest only when writing table
