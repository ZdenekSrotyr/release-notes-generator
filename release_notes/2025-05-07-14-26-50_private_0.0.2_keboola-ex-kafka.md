## Change log (AI generated):
## Kafka Producer Enhancements: Performance Boost & Stricter Configuration
Our Kafka producer has been updated for potentially higher throughput and more robust configuration, alongside important changes to message handling.

We've refined how our Kafka producer interacts with your data streams. Key changes include a move towards more asynchronous message sending even within the `SyncKafkaProducer`, which can significantly boost throughput. This means the producer won't wait for an acknowledgement for every single message before proceeding. Additionally, when the producer shuts down, the process of flushing any remaining messages now includes a timeout to prevent indefinite hangs.

Furthermore, we've enhanced configuration validation for `kafka_extra_params` used with the producer. These parameters must now be a dictionary with string keys and values, and they have been relocated to `parameters.producer` in your configuration JSON. This change ensures greater stability and predictability when passing custom settings to the Kafka client.

Please be aware of these adjustments:
*   The shift to more asynchronous sending in `SyncKafkaProducer` improves performance but introduces a slight risk of message loss if your application terminates unexpectedly before all buffered messages are sent.
*   The new flush timeout during shutdown protects against unresponsive Kafka brokers but could result in data loss if messages cannot be sent before the timeout.
*   Configurations using `kafka_extra_params` at the root level or with non-string keys/values will need to be updated to the new structure and validation rules to prevent errors.
