## Kafka Update: Stronger Delivery Assurance & Easier Setup
Updates to our Kafka Connector bring more reliable synchronous message sending and improved flexibility for advanced configurations.

We've enhanced our Kafka Connector to provide stronger delivery assurance for synchronous operations and offer more flexible, robust ways to configure advanced Kafka settings.

The most significant change impacts synchronous message sending (`send_records_sync`). Previously, the Kafka producer would flush messages only once after attempting to send an entire batch. Now, it flushes after *each individual record*. This ensures that the delivery of each message is attempted and acknowledged (or timed out) before processing the next one in the batch. This significantly boosts the reliability of each message delivery within a synchronous operation, providing greater confidence that your data has been sent, though it might introduce a slight increase in latency for very large batches.

Setting up advanced Kafka parameters is now more versatile and safer. The `kafka_extra_params` can be defined either as a multi-line string of key-value pairs or as a list of dictionaries. We've also added robust validation to correctly parse these formats and catch any misconfigurations early. This helps ensure your Kafka client is initialized with the intended settings, preventing potential data processing issues.

Additionally, we've refined the error message for timeouts during synchronous sends to provide clearer information. These improvements are designed to make your data integration with Kafka smoother and more dependable.
