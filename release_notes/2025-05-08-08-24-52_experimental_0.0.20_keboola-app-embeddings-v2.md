Title: Focus on Stability: No Data Processing Changes in Version 0.0.20
Excerpt: This latest update, version 0.0.20, prioritizes stability with no alterations to core data processing logic or functionalities.
Post detail:
We've released version 0.0.20, continuing our commitment to a stable and reliable platform experience.
A thorough review of the changes between version 0.0.19 and 0.0.20 confirms that there have been no modifications to the main Python code that would alter its data processing logic or operational behavior. The updates included in this release are confined to internal code comments and enhancements to description and longDescription fields in configuration files. These changes improve UI text and documentation clarity but do not impact how parameters are handled or how data processing tasks are executed.
Rest assured, your existing data workflows and component configurations will continue to function as before, with no impact from this version update.
