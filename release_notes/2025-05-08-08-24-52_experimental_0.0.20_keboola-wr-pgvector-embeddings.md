## Change log (AI generated):
## Platform Update: Stability Enhancements, Core Processing Unchanged
Recent platform updates focused on internal stability; core data processing logic remains consistent for all users.

Our latest platform updates have centered on backend stability and foundational improvements. This work, crucial for the long-term health and performance of Keboola, involved enhancements to our CI/CD pipelines, testing suites, and internal documentation.

While these behind-the-scenes efforts ensure a more robust platform, this cycle does not introduce new features or alterations to the core data processing functionalities. Your existing projects and data operations will continue to function without change, benefiting from the increased resilience of our underlying systems.
