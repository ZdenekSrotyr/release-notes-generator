**Component:** [keboola.wr-pinecone-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.20](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.20)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component: Increased Resilience for OpenAI & Azure Calls
The Embeddings component now features improved error handling for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI API interactions, boosting reliability and ensuring smoother data processing.

We've strengthened the Embeddings component to better handle temporary issues when communicating with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI services.
The component will now intelligently retry on a wider range of API errors, including `APIStatusError`, which can indicate various transient problems. This enhancement means that if the OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API experiences a momentary disruption, the component has a higher likelihood of successfully retrying and completing your embedding generation tasks.
For you, this translates to more robust and dependable data processing, reducing failures due to intermittent API glitches and leading to more consistently complete datasets. This improvement is facilitated by an update to the `openai` library. Additionally, we've made minor updates to log message formatting for improved readability.
