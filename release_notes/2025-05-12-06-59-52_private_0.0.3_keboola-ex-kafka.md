## Change log (AI generated):
## Kafka Component Update: Streamlined Single-Topic Processing
Our Kafka component now processes a single Kafka topic for produce and consume actions, requiring a topic to be specified for these operations.

We've updated our Kafka component (keboola/component-kafka) to enhance clarity and focus in its data processing. The component now operates with a single Kafka topic for both producing and consuming messages within a single execution.

Previously, the component could handle a list of topics. This has been simplified: the configuration parameter for specifying topics has changed from accepting a list to accepting a single topic name. This means when producing data, it will be sent only to this one specified topic. Similarly, when consuming, data will be read only from this single topic. If your previous configurations involved multiple topics for a single component run, you will need to adjust them to target one topic per execution.

Furthermore, specifying a topic is now mandatory for `produce` and `consume` actions. If the `topic` parameter is not provided for these operations, the component will raise a `ValueError` and stop processing. This change provides clearer error handling and ensures that data processing actions are always explicitly targeted. Please note that the `list_topics` action, which doesn't require a specific topic, remains unaffected by this requirement.

These updates aim to make the Kafka component more robust and its behavior more predictable. We encourage you to review your existing Kafka component configurations to align with this new single-topic approach and ensure the `topic` parameter is set for all produce and consume operations.



## Changes:



- set default none for topic param (for listing topics by sync action), renamed topics to topic in writer UI, update version files 




- change topic param from list to string 




- PR #8
