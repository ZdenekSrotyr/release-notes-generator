## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Kafka Writer: Simplified Topic Config & New Discovery Feature
Excerpt: Our Kafka writer's topic configuration is now more focused, using an updated parameter for a single topic, and adds a sync action to list Kafka topics.

Post Detail:
We've enhanced the Kafka writer component, introducing a more streamlined approach to topic configuration and a new feature for topic discovery.

There are key changes to how target Kafka topics are specified. The configuration parameter used to define the Kafka topic has been updated (for instance, potentially changing from a plural name like `topics` to a singular name `topic`). This parameter now accepts a single topic name, guiding data to one specific destination per component execution; previously, a list might have been supported. This new topic parameter is also optional by default.

Action Required for Existing Configurations: If you are using the Kafka writer, please review and update your component configurations. You'll need to use the new parameter name and ensure a single topic is specified if your goal is data production.

The most significant new capability is triggered when this topic parameter is left unset. In this scenario, instead of producing data, the component will perform a "list topics" sync action. This allows you to conveniently discover available topics within your Kafka setup directly.

This update brings several benefits:
-   Simplified Setup: Easier configuration for sending data to a specific Kafka topic.
-   Focused Output: Ensures clarity by directing data to a single, well-defined stream per writer instance.
-   Integrated Topic Discovery: Quickly list and verify Kafka topics without needing external tools, directly within your Keboola workflow.



## Changes:



- set default none for topic param (for listing topics by sync action), renamed topics to topic in writer UI, update version files 




- change topic param from list to string 




- PR #8
