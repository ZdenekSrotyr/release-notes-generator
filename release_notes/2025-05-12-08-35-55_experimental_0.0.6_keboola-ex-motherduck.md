## Change log (AI generated):
## Unlock New Data Capabilities: DuckDB Extensions Now Supported!
Easily load DuckDB extensions like `httpfs` and `json` directly in your component configurations, significantly expanding your data processing power and accessing diverse data sources.

We're thrilled to announce a powerful upgrade to our platform: you can now load and utilize DuckDB extensions within your components! This significantly enhances your data processing capabilities.

### Harness the Power of DuckDB Extensions
You can now define a list of desired DuckDB extensions (e.g., `httpfs`, `json`) directly in your component configuration. The platform will automatically handle installing (if necessary) and loading these extensions when the `MotherDuckClient` establishes a connection.

This unlocks a wide array of new possibilities:
*   **Access New Data Sources:** Read files directly from HTTP/S URLs using the `httpfs` extension.
*   **Advanced Data Parsing:** Leverage enhanced JSON processing capabilities with the `json` extension.
*   **Specialized Functions:** Utilize a broad range of functions and operators from various other extensions for tasks like spatial data analysis or full-text search.

### Smarter Guidance for Your Queries
To make working with these new extension capabilities smoother, we've also improved error handling in the `MotherDuckClient`. If a query fails because it needs an extension that isn't loaded (e.g., due to an `AUTOLOAD_MISSING_EXTENSION` error or a missing function), you'll now receive a more informative `UserException`. This will guide you to ensure the necessary extensions are specified in your component configuration, making it easier to diagnose issues and use advanced, extension-dependent features.

Additionally, connections to MotherDuck are now established more robustly. Methods that perform database operations now ensure an active connection by calling `_connect()` if one is not already established. This means any configured DuckDB extensions are loaded "just-in-time" before your first data operation, making the component more resilient and ensuring your data processing prerequisites are met.



## Changes:



- added autoload dependency, init client without destination (for sync actions)
