## Change log (AI generated):
## MotherDuck Component: Enhanced Table Discovery & Connection Flexibility

Our MotherDuck component now offers more flexible connections and a new way to explore your available tables.

The `keboola/component-motherduck` (version `0.0.6`) has been updated to enhance how you interact with your MotherDuck environment.

Previously, connecting to MotherDuck always required specifying a destination database. We've now made this optional, allowing the component to initialize a connection without a pre-defined database. This change enables broader operations, such as listing all databases or tables accessible by your MotherDuck token, without being tied to a specific destination.

Building on this enhanced connectivity, we've introduced a new synchronous action: `get_tables`. This action allows you to easily retrieve a list of all tables available in your MotherDuck environment that your configured token has access to. This is particularly useful for data discovery and understanding the scope of your accessible data directly within Keboola.



## Changes:



- added autoload dependency, init client without destination (for sync actions)
