## Change log (AI generated):
MotherDuck Component: `database` & `db_schema` Parameters Now Require Explicit Values
This update to our MotherDuck component removes default empty string values for `database` and `db_schema`, requiring explicit configuration for improved data processing reliability.

We've updated the MotherDuck component to enhance configuration precision by removing default empty string values for two key parameters: `database` and `db_schema`. This change requires users to explicitly define these settings for more predictable and reliable behavior.

Previously, the `database` parameter, if left unset, defaulted to an empty string. This could inadvertently lead to operations on a temporary in-memory DuckDB. Now, this parameter must be explicitly provided. This change ensures your operations are targeted to the intended database, preventing accidental data handling and making database specification a strict requirement. If this parameter is missing, processing may fail.

Similarly, the `db_schema` parameter no longer defaults to an empty string. When not specified, it will now result in `None`, typically causing DuckDB to use its standard default schema (e.g., `main`). This approach offers more robust schema management and aligns better with expected DuckDB behavior, avoiding potential issues linked to an empty string schema.

To ensure smooth continuation of your data workflows, please review your MotherDuck component configurations. Explicitly setting the `database` and `db_schema` parameters will help maintain intended behavior and prevent potential disruptions.



## Changes:



- add default values: "" to database a db_schema
