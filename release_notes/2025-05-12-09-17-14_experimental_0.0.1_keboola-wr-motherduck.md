#  keboola.wr-motherduck 0.0.1

_Released on 2025-05-12_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-motherduck](https://github.com/keboola/component-motherduck)  
**Tag:** [0.0.1](https://github.com/keboola/component-motherduck/releases/tag/0.0.1)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Update to Automatic Primary Key Detection in Advanced Mode
The logic for automatically setting primary keys for output tables in advanced mode (when not explicitly defined) has been updated.

We've updated the mechanism for automatic primary key detection in "advanced mode" for your output tables. If you do not explicitly define primary keys, the system will now use a different method for their identification.
This change means the previously used `self.db_client.list_table_primary_keys` method for this specific auto-detection is no longer in effect. As a result, the way primary keys are identified and set for output tables changes if they are not explicitly configured. This could lead to tables having missing or different primary keys compared to the previous behavior, potentially affecting how data is structured or updated in Keboola Storage. We recommend reviewing your advanced mode configurations where primary keys are not explicitly set.

## Change in Data Typing for Primary Key Columns
The data type for primary key columns in output table definitions will no longer be uniformly enforced as TEXT.

There has been a change in how data types are assigned to primary key columns in your output table manifests. Previously, primary key columns were uniformly typed as `TEXT`. This enforcement has been removed.
Going forward, the data types for primary key columns will be determined by an earlier logic, which might use the source table's original types or a different default. This will affect the data types specified in the generated `.csv.manifest` files for your output tables. This update could reintroduce variability in primary key data types and may impact data type consistency or how these keys are indexed and used in Keboola Storage.

## ACTION REQUIRED: Update to Default Database & Schema Parameters
Default values for `database` and `db_schema` parameters have changed from empty string (`""`) to `None`; explicit configuration is likely now required to prevent connection issues.

We're announcing an important update regarding the default values for `database` and `db_schema` parameters within the component configuration. If these parameters are not explicitly provided, their default values have changed from an empty string (`""`) back to `None`.
This change has a critical impact on connectivity:
- Previously (with `""` default), omitting the `database` parameter likely resulted in a connection to the default MotherDuck database.
- Now (with `None` default), if the `database` parameter is omitted, the connection string will attempt to use "None" as the database name (e.g., `md:None?motherduck_token=...`), which will likely cause a connection failure.
To ensure continued data accessibility, please review your configurations and explicitly provide the `database` parameter if it was previously omitted and relying on the empty string default.

## Revision of Output Table Processing Logic
The component's output table processing has been revised, reverting to an older, unified logic and removing distinct "advanced" and "simple" mode handling.

The logic for processing output tables has undergone a significant revision. The previous system, which included separate handling for "advanced mode" and "simple mode" (using `handle_output_table_advanced_mode` and `handle_output_table_simple_mode` respectively), has been consolidated. The component now utilizes an older, unified `handle_output_table` logic.
This change means that methods for discovering table columns (e.g., usage of `list_table_columns_extended`), determining data types, and identifying primary keys (e.g., usage of `list_table_primary_keys`) revert to previous implementations. Consequently, how output table schemas are defined and written to manifests will be substantially different, potentially altering column names, types, and primary key definitions. Features specific to the "advanced mode" previously available will no longer be active. This will impact the data structure in Keboola Storage.

## Update to Source Table Metadata Fetching
The component will now use an older method for fetching source table metadata, which may provide less detailed information.

We have updated the way metadata for source tables is fetched. The component will no longer use the enhanced `list_tables_extended` method in `MotherDuckClient`, which previously provided detailed table information including `schema_name` and `database_name` from `information_schema.tables`.
Instead, the component will rely on older table listing methods, which may offer less detailed metadata. As a result, less information about source tables, such as explicit schema names per table, will be programmatically available. This could affect how tables are identified, particularly in databases with multiple schemas. If your queries or configurations relied on the detailed schema information previously available, you might experience ambiguity or incorrect table access if queries now depend on a default schema context that isn't the intended one.

---
## Important Update: MotherDuck Token Authentication Method
The option to acquire the MotherDuck token via OAuth (using `image_parameters`) has been removed; direct parameter input is now required.

There's an important change to how the `motherduck_token` is acquired for authentication. The logic that preferentially obtained the token from `image_parameters` (typically used for OAuth-provided secrets in Keboola) has been removed.
The component will now solely rely on the `motherduck_token` (or `#motherduck_token`) provided directly in the user configuration parameters.
If your component was configured to use an OAuth flow for the MotherDuck token, this authentication method will no longer work. To ensure continued data access, you must reconfigure the component by providing the token directly through the standard parameter input. Failure to do so may result in authentication issues and prevent data access.

---
## Updates to Component Manifest Configuration
Internal updates have been made to the component's manifest file, affecting platform integration and parameter definition.

We've made two adjustments to the component's `manifest.json` file, which defines how the component interacts with the Keboola platform:
1.  **Table Output Declaration:** The manifest has been updated to re-include the `"output": "tables"` declaration. This restores the explicit signal to the Keboola platform that the component produces standard table outputs.
2.  **Parameter Naming:** A previous correction of a typo in a required image parameter field (from `parmeters` to `parameters` within `image_parameters.keboola.com.docker_image.required`) has been reverted. The field name in the manifest will now be `parmeters`. This change might affect how the Keboola platform validates or interprets required image parameters, potentially leading to configuration warnings or issues if the platform specifically relies on the corrected spelling.
These changes primarily affect the component's interaction with the Keboola platform.
