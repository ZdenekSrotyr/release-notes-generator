## Change log (AI generated):
## MotherDuck Connector: Simplified Connection & Default Handling
Our MotherDuck connector now features a streamlined connection to your token's default database and updated default behavior for schema parameters.

We've released an update (version 0.0.7) for the MotherDuck connector (`keboola/component-motherduck`) that simplifies its connection logic and modifies how database and schema configurations are handled.

Hereâ€™s what has changed:
*   **Direct Connection to Default Database:** The connector now establishes a connection directly to the default MotherDuck database associated with your provided `motherduck_token`. The previous mechanism for specifying a particular database (e.g., `your_db_name.db`) during the initial connection setup has been removed. This means the component will always start its session in your MotherDuck token's default database.
*   **Operations Use Default Schema:** The component no longer automatically sets an active schema (e.g., by running `USE your_schema;`). Your SQL queries will now operate within MotherDuck's default schema for the connected database, unless you explicitly qualify table names (e.g., `your_specific_schema.your_table`).
*   **New Defaults for `database` and `db_schema`:** The configuration parameters `database` and `db_schema` now default to an empty string (`""`) if not provided. If these parameters are left empty, subsequent operations might target a default database/schema as interpreted by MotherDuck, or could lead to errors if an empty string is used directly in qualifications (e.g., `"".schema.table`).

These updates are designed to make configuring the MotherDuck connector more straightforward, especially for users working within their default MotherDuck environment.

**Action Required:** If your existing setups relied on the component connecting to a specific, non-default database at startup, or if you depended on the `db_schema` parameter to automatically set the schema context for your queries, please review your component configurations and SQL statements. You may need to adjust your queries to use fully qualified table names to ensure they interact with the intended data.
