## Change log (AI generated):
## MotherDuck Component Aligns with Session Default Database
Our MotherDuck component now defaults to using the MotherDuck session's current database when no specific database is configured, enhancing flexibility.

We've refined how our MotherDuck component handles database selection when you don't explicitly specify a database in your configuration.

Previously, if no database was set, the component would automatically attempt to use the "main" database. With the latest update, if a `database` is not specified in the component configuration, it will now use the MotherDuck session's current default database. This change ensures that your queries run against the intended database context established in your session, preventing scenarios where operations might unintentionally target the "main" database if it was not your session's active default.

This adjustment streamlines configuration and provides a more intuitive experience, aligning the component's behavior more closely with standard database practices. If you relied on the previous behavior of automatically switching to "main" without specifying it, please review your configurations to ensure they target the correct database.

Additionally, the internal default for an unspecified `db_schema` parameter has been updated. This change primarily affects internal representation and does not alter the existing behavior: if no schema is specified, no command to switch schemas is executed.



## Changes:



- add default values: "" to database a db_schema
