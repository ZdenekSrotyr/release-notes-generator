## Change log (AI generated):
## Level Up Your Custom Python: Now with Python 3.10 and Pandas!
Upgrade your Custom Python scripts with Python 3.10 support, pre-installed `pandas`, and a simplified execution flow for a more powerful and streamlined experience.

We're excited to announce significant enhancements to our Custom Python component (version 0.2.0), designed to make your custom data processing tasks more powerful and straightforward.

Key updates include:
*   **Python 3.10 Support**: Your custom scripts will now run on Python 3.10. This brings access to the latest Python features and improvements. Please ensure your existing code is compatible with this newer version, as changes in Python versions can sometimes subtly alter script behavior.
*   **`pandas` Now Included**: The popular `pandas` library is now a direct dependency and readily available for your scripts. Leverage its powerful DataFrames and functions for advanced data manipulation and analysis without needing to add it manually. The underlying Keboola library may also utilize `pandas`, potentially refining how data is handled.
*   **Simplified Execution and Cleaner `run()` Method**: We've streamlined the component's operation. The `run()` method is now the single, clear entry point for all your custom logic. Extensive example code previously within `run()` has been removed. This provides a cleaner slate, ensuring any data processing or file creation comes entirely from your code.

Additionally, the underlying `keboola-python-component-library` has been updated, and we've improved Python environment management for better stability and reliability. These updates to the core library can influence how configuration is parsed or how input/output tables are managed.

One technical adjustment to be aware of: if the `KBC_DATADIR` environment variable is not set (which is typically managed by the Keboola platform), the component will now use `../data` (relative to the script's location) as the default data directory instead of the previous `/data/`. This could affect where your script looks for input or writes output if `KBC_DATADIR` is not defined in your environment.

These changes aim to enhance your development experience and the capabilities of your custom Python transformations in Keboola.
