## Change log (AI generated):
## Optimized Python Environment Creation with UV
The Python environment setup now uses a more robust `uv` command for greater stability in your custom scripts.

We've enhanced the way Python virtual environments are created and packages are installed when your custom Python code runs. The method using the `uv` tool has been updated for better efficiency and reliability.

Specifically, the process has been consolidated from two `uv` commands (one for environment creation, one for package installation) into a single `uv pip install` command that now also handles the virtual environment creation implicitly. This refinement aims to make the environment setup more robust by aligning with `uv`'s recommended practices and addressing a potential tool-related warning. The direct benefit is a more stable and correctly configured execution environment, which is crucial for ensuring your Python scripts operate as expected and your data processing remains accurate and consistent. Rest assured, the Python version and packages you define in your component configurations are not impacted by this internal improvement.
