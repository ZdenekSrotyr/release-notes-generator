## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Refined Error Logging for Application & User Exceptions
Excerpt: Updates to how Application and User Exceptions are logged may change the detail in error messages, aiming for more focused diagnostics.

Post detail:
We're refining how errors are logged for `ApplicationException` and `UserException` types within our Python components to improve diagnostic clarity.

Here’s what’s new:
- **Dedicated Handling for `ApplicationException`**: These exceptions now have a specific handler. While data processing will still terminate as expected (exit code 2), this allows for more targeted error management.
- **Modified Logging for Key Exceptions**: Both `ApplicationException` and `UserException` (which continues to halt processing with exit code 1) will now be logged using a method that focuses on the error message, rather than one that automatically includes a full stack trace.

What this means for you:
You may notice a change in the error log details for `ApplicationException` and `UserException`. Previously, full stack traces were automatically included with these error messages. Our updated logging for these exceptions now focuses on the exception message itself and does not automatically append a stack trace. This often results in more concise error messages, directing attention to the primary error information. A stack trace might still be visible if it's part of the specific exception's own descriptive text.

Importantly, the overall behavior—how your processes terminate and the exit codes they return upon encountering these exceptions—remains unchanged. Other concurrent code style refinements do not impact data processing logic or the information available for generic exceptions.
