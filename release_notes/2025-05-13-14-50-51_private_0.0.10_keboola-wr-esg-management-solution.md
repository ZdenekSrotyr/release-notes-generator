## Pinpoint Errors Faster: Enhanced Sheet-Specific Error Reporting
We've improved error messages to include the specific sheet name and more details, speeding up your troubleshooting process.

We've rolled out an update to enhance the error reporting mechanism within our components. When an issue arises during the processing of an individual sheet, you'll now receive more insightful error messages.

These improved messages will clearly identify the name of the sheet that encountered the problem and provide details about the original cause of the error. This means you get a fuller picture, making it easier to trace the root of the issue and understand the complete context for debugging.

While this change doesn't alter your data output or the success/failure conditions of your processing, it significantly improves the troubleshooting experience. With more context-aware error information, you can diagnose and resolve issues related to specific sheets much more quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall troubleshootability of the component.

- better error logging
