## Change log (AI generated):
## ESG Extractor: Dynamic API Endpoint Selection
The ESG data extractor now dynamically selects its API endpoint, allowing it to fetch data from different environments based on your project settings.

We've updated the ESG data extractor to provide greater flexibility when working with different environments. The extractor now dynamically determines the API base URL from which it fetches data.

By default, data will be sourced from `https://ex-esg.keboola.com`. However, if your project is running with the environment variable `KBC_PROJECTID` set to `264`, the extractor will automatically switch to use `https://ex-esg.app-dev.keboola.com`.

This enhancement allows for seamless switching between different data sources, such as production and development environments, depending on your project's configuration. It's important to note that the data extracted might differ if the underlying data or API behavior varies between these environments. This change ensures you can precisely target the data source relevant to your specific workflow needs, such as testing or development against non-production systems.
