## Change log (AI generated):
Title: ESG Component: Now with Configurable API Base URL & Updated Endpoints
Excerpt: Our ESG component now offers a configurable API base URL for greater flexibility and connects via updated authentication and default API endpoints.

Post Detail:
We've rolled out important updates to the ESG component, enhancing its flexibility and modernizing its connections.

The most significant change is that the API Base URL is now configurable directly from the component parameters. You can now specify the `base_url` your component connects to, allowing you to easily switch between different API environments like development, staging, or production, or connect to specific regional instances. This gives you precise control over your ESG data source. Please note, if this `base_url` parameter is not provided or is left empty, data retrieval may be impacted if the underlying `ESGClient` does not have a default or cannot handle an empty URL.

To ensure secure and reliable access, the authentication endpoint (`TOKEN_URL`) used by the `ESGClient` has been updated to `https://esg.auth.dataprovider.com/oauth2/token`. This change helps maintain compatibility and robust authentication with the ESG data provider's services.

Further enhancements include an update to the default hardcoded `BASE_URL` constant within the client library (to `https://esg.api.dataprovider.com/v1`), promoting consistency across related tools, even though the component now prioritizes your specific `base_url` configuration. The `ESGClient` is also now initialized at the start of the component's run, ensuring it uses the most current configuration parameters.

These updates aim to provide you with more adaptable and reliable ESG data integration capabilities.
