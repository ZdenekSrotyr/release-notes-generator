## Change log (AI generated):
## ESG Component Update: Cleaner, Standardized Output Table Names
The ESG component now automatically sanitizes output table names, replacing special characters with underscores for improved consistency and downstream compatibility.

Introducing an enhancement to our `keboola/component-esg` (version 0.0.12): automatic sanitization of output table names.
By default, any non-alphanumeric characters (excluding underscores) in your table names will now be replaced with underscores. For instance, a table previously named "ESG-Ratings" will automatically become "ESG_Ratings". This change primarily affects table metadata and how downstream processes reference these tables; the data *within* your tables remains unaltered.
This update ensures greater consistency, prevents potential issues caused by special characters in table names, and simplifies referencing these tables in your data workflows. This feature is enabled by a new `sanitize_table_names` parameter, which defaults to `True`.

## ESG Component Configuration Streamlined: `template_id` Parameter Removed
We've simplified the `keboola/component-esg` (version 0.0.12) configuration by removing the `template_id` parameter.

To streamline the configuration of our ESG component, the `template_id` parameter has been removed and is no longer read or used.
If you previously relied on `template_id` to select specific data extraction templates or to alter the logic for fetching data, the component will now operate using its default behavior, which is not conditional on `template_id`.
This change might result in different datasets being extracted or a change in the scope or structure of the extracted data if `template_id` was a critical input for your data selection. We recommend reviewing your component configuration and output to ensure it aligns with your current requirements.

## Boost ESG Data Reliability: Configurable API Retries Introduced
Enhance the robustness of your ESG data extraction with newly introduced configurable API client retries in `keboola/component-esg` (version 0.0.12).

We're making data extraction with the ESG component more resilient! The HTTP client used for API calls now supports configurable retries for increased reliability.
A new configuration parameter, `client_max_retries`, has been introduced, defaulting to 3. This means the component will automatically retry failed API requests up to the specified number of times before failing.
This enhancement significantly improves the chances of successful data fetching, especially in cases of transient network errors or temporary API unavailability. The result is more complete and reliable datasets loaded into Keboola Storage with potentially less manual intervention needed for temporary issues.
