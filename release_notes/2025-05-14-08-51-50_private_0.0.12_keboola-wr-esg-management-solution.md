Title: ESG Component Enhanced: Granular Data Extraction & Output Control
Excerpt: The ESG component now offers more precise control over output table naming, selective data extraction, API request customization, and default output bucket settings.

Post detail:
We've rolled out an update to the ESG component (version 0.0.12), introducing several key features that provide you with more granular control over how your data is extracted and where it lands.

Here’s what’s new:

Flexible Output Table Naming:
You now have greater flexibility in naming your output tables. A new `use_view_name_as_table_name` option (defaults to `False`) allows you to use a template's `view_name` as the base for the output table name, instead of `table_name`. All chosen names are then sanitized to ensure they are valid Keboola table identifiers. This can help you align table names more closely with your reporting views if desired.

Conditional Data Extraction by Template:
Gain more control over which data is processed with the new `default_export` flag (defaults to `True`) in each template's configuration. If you set this to `False` for a specific template, that template will be skipped, and its data will not be extracted. This allows for more targeted data pipelines.

Advanced API Parameter Overrides:
We've refined how data extraction requests are made to the ESG API. While `template_id` is no longer a direct configuration, a new `config_values_override` dictionary has been added. This powerful feature allows you to directly modify parameters sent to the ESG API for each template, giving you the ability to customize the dataset queried or how data is returned by the API.

Simplified Default Output Bucket Management:
The Writer component now includes a `default_bucket` configuration option (defaults to `False`). If set to `True`, any table configuration that doesn't specify a destination bucket will automatically write data to a default input bucket in your Keboola project (e.g., `in.c-<component_id>`). This streamlines the setup for common output scenarios.

Additionally, to optimize performance and provide clearer feedback in case of persistent API issues, the maximum number of retries for API requests has been adjusted to 3.

These enhancements aim to make the ESG component more adaptable to your specific data integration requirements, offering you more power and precision.



## Changes:



- EX - sanitize tables names, removed template_id, added default values to config 




- EX - fix config
