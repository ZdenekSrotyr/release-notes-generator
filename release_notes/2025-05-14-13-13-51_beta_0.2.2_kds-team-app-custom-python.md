## Change log (AI generated):
## Python Custom Component: Enhanced Reliability with `uv` Integration
The Custom Python Component now leverages `uv` for improved package installation and script execution, ensuring your data processing runs smoother and more reliably.

We've enhanced the Custom Python Component to provide greater reliability and consistency for your custom Python scripts. These updates refine how dependencies are managed and how your code is executed, leading to more robust data processing workflows within the Keboola platform.

A key improvement is the adoption of `uv pip install` for installing user-defined Python packages. This change ensures that all your specified dependencies are correctly installed into the appropriate virtual environment, making them readily available for your scripts. This directly impacts data processing by enabling user scripts that depend on these packages to execute as intended.

Furthermore, custom Python scripts are now executed using `uv run -- python`. This approach guarantees that your scripts operate within the same `uv`-managed virtual environment where their dependencies were installed. This provides a consistent and correct runtime, resolving potential issues where scripts might not find required packages or inadvertently use a different Python environment, ultimately making your data processing tasks more dependable.

Additionally, the underlying `keboola-python-component-utils` library has been updated to its latest version. This brings in recent bug fixes and minor enhancements, which can contribute to smoother data handling operations within the component.

Together, these updates make running your custom Python code in Keboola more predictable and robust, ensuring your data processing pipelines function as expected.
