## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Reliability for Python Transformations
Our Python transformations now feature improved package management, ensuring your script environments are more accurate and dependable.

We've rolled out an update to our Python transformations designed to enhance the reliability and predictability of your script executions. These changes refine how Python environments are created and how packages are managed.

Key Improvements:
- **More Accurate Package Environments:** We've improved the virtual environment setup to ensure packages can be properly uninstalled. If you remove a package from your `requirements.txt` or update a package to a new version that requires uninstalling the old one, this will now happen reliably. This prevents issues from lingering or conflicting packages, ensuring your script's environment precisely matches your defined dependencies.
- **Optimized Package Installation:** The command used to install packages with the `uv` manager has been updated to align with its standard invocation. This change helps ensure we're leveraging `uv`'s capabilities efficiently, potentially leading to more consistent dependency resolution.

These enhancements mean your Python transformations will run in cleaner, more accurate environments, reducing unexpected behavior and making your data processing workflows more robust.
