## BigQuery Permissions: Enhanced Accuracy and Reliability
Updates to BigQuery dataset access management ensure more precise and reliable control over your data permissions.

We've enhanced how Keboola manages access permissions for your BigQuery datasets, providing you with more precise and reliable control. This update significantly improves the way changes to dataset access control lists (ACLs) are handled.

When you modify an entity's role (such as for a user, group, or service account), our system now ensures greater accuracy. If an existing access entry has a different role, the old entry is explicitly removed before the new one is applied. If no entry exists, a new one is cleanly added. This meticulous process guarantees that the list of access entries sent to BigQuery accurately reflects your desired final permission settings, with at most one entry per entity.

The key benefit is more robust and dependable management of your BigQuery dataset permissions. This ensures that ACLs are always set as intended, particularly when updating roles. Ultimately, this translates to stronger data security and clearer accessibility, confirming that the right entities have the correct level of access to your views and underlying datasets.
