## New MotherDuck Extractor: Seamless Data Ingestion
Introducing our new MotherDuck Extractor, enabling full and incremental data extraction from your MotherDuck databases into Keboola.

We're excited to announce the addition of the MotherDuck Extractor (`ex_motherduck`) to our component library! This new component allows you to effortlessly pull data from your MotherDuck databases directly into your Keboola projects.

The MotherDuck Extractor supports both full table extractions and efficient incremental loading. For incremental updates, it intelligently uses the first primary key defined in your configuration, fetching only new or updated rows since the last successful run by querying `SELECT * FROM "table_name" WHERE "pk_column" > 'last_pk_value' ORDER BY "pk_column" ASC`. State is managed by storing the maximum primary key value from the last successful extraction, ensuring data consistency. We've also refined state handling: if `MAX(pk)` from the table returns a value, it becomes the new state; if `MAX(pk)` is `NULL` (e.g., table is empty), the previous state is retained, or no state is written if none existed.

Data is exported using MotherDuck's `COPY (SELECT ... ) TO ? (HEADER, DELIMITER ',')` command, where the output file path is securely parameterized. Enhanced logging provides better visibility into the extraction process, especially for incremental loads, and clear warnings guide you if multiple primary keys are specified, as only the first is used for incremental fetching.

## Execute Custom SQL: New MotherDuck Raw Query Action
Gain direct control over your MotherDuck data with our new Raw Query Action, allowing execution of any SQL statement.

Take full command of your MotherDuck environment with the new MotherDuck Raw Query Action (`action_raw_query`). This versatile component empowers you to execute arbitrary SQL queries directly against your MotherDuck databases.

Whether you need to perform Data Definition Language (DDL) operations like creating or altering tables, Data Manipulation Language (DML) tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data, or run other custom SQL statements, the Raw Query Action provides the flexibility you need. It processes a list of queries sequentially, and we've included refined error handling to ensure clear reporting and proper termination if any query fails. This action also benefits from more robust MotherDuck token retrieval for reliable connections.
