## Unlock Your MotherDuck Data: New Extractor Now Available!
Our new MotherDuck extractor lets you seamlessly ingest data, with robust querying, selective column extraction, and accurate type conversions into Keboola.

We're excited to announce the launch of our new MotherDuck Extractor (`ex-motherduck`), designed to simplify ingesting data from MotherDuck into Keboola. This powerful component allows you to connect to your MotherDuck instance, execute custom SQL queries, or select entire tables for extraction, complete with manifest generation.

Key enhancements in this release focus on flexibility, reliability, and accuracy:

*   **Robust Data Extraction:** SQL query construction is now more resilient, with automatic quoting of table and column names (e.g., `SELECT * FROM "my_table"`). This ensures reliable data fetching, even if your database object names contain spaces, special characters, or are SQL keywords.
*   **Selective Column Extraction:** You now have the flexibility to choose specific columns when extracting from tables (e.g., `SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM "my_table"`), instead of always fetching all columns. This helps reduce data volume processed and can improve the performance of your data pipelines.
*   **Accurate Data Typing:** Data type conversions from DuckDB to Keboola have been refined and expanded. We've added support for `HUGEINT` and `TIME` DuckDB types, which are now correctly converted to `STRING` in Keboola, ensuring your data is accurately represented.
*   **Smarter Incremental Loading & Metadata Handling:** To ensure data integrity, incremental loading is now exclusively supported for table-based extractions; attempting this with custom queries will raise an error. For custom SQL queries, column metadata (names and types) is now derived more accurately from query results, leading to correct output table structures and manifests.

These updates provide a more powerful and reliable way to integrate your MotherDuck data into the Keboola platform, allowing you to harness its capabilities with greater confidence.
