## Change log (AI generated):
## Say Goodbye to CSV Field Size Limits!
Our Python components can now effortlessly handle CSV files with exceptionally large field values, preventing previous parsing errors.

You no longer need to worry about your CSV processing failing due to individual fields exceeding size limits. We've updated our Python environment to accommodate even the most extensive field content.

Previously, if a CSV file contained a cell with a very long text string, an embedded JSON object, or any other large piece of data, it could trigger a `_csv.Error: field larger than field limit`. This update effectively removes that limitation by setting the maximum field size to the largest possible value. This means your components can now reliably read and process CSV files with exceptionally large individual fields, ensuring smoother data ingestion and transformation for data that might have been rejected before. Enjoy more robust and flexible CSV data handling!
