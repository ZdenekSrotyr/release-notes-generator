Refined AI Connections: OpenAI/Azure API Versions & Bedrock Update
This update provides more control over OpenAI/Azure OpenAI services via API versioning and resolves a key configuration issue for AWS Bedrock.

We're pleased to announce two key improvements for integrations with AI services on our platform, enhancing both reliability and control.

Firstly, we have addressed an issue affecting AWS Bedrock connectivity. A typo in the environment variable for the AWS Bedrock secret access key (previously `KBC_AWS_BEDROCK_SECRECT_ACCESS_KEY`) has been corrected to `KBC_AWS_BEDROCK_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. This fix ensures your secret key is loaded correctly, allowing for proper authentication and smoother data interaction with AWS Bedrock services. If you were experiencing connection issues due to this misconfiguration, this update should resolve them.

Secondly, we've introduced greater flexibility for your OpenAI and Azure OpenAI service integrations. You can now specify the API version for these services by setting either the `KBC_OPENAI_API_VERSION` environment variable or the `KBC_PROJECT_OPENAI_API_VERSION` project secret. This empowers you to select specific API versions, which can influence the models available, features, and overall behavior of the AI service. Tailoring the API version helps you leverage the latest advancements or maintain consistency with specific model outputs for your data processing tasks.

These updates are aimed at providing a more robust and customizable experience when working with AI services within Keboola.
