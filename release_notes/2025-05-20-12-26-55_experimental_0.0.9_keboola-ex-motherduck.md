_Released on 2025-05-20_

**Component:** [keboola.ex-motherduck](https://github.com/keboola/component-motherduck)  
**Tag:** [0.0.9](https://github.com/keboola/component-motherduck/releases/tag/0.0.9)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Extractor Update: Query Row Limit Now Optional
The query row limit parameter in extractors is now optional, defaulting to retrieving all rows if not specified.

Previously, the parameter for limiting query rows (e.g., `limit_rows`) might have been mandatory or had an implicit default. Now, this setting is optional. If you don't specify a row limit, the extractor will return all matching rows from your query.
This change provides greater flexibility, ensuring you get the complete dataset by default. If you need to limit the number of rows, simply provide a positive value for the parameter, and a `LIMIT` clause will be included in the SQL query.

## Enhanced Writer: Predictable Data Output with Mode Fixes
Updates to our writer component ensure data write modes (e.g., REPLACE, APPEND) are handled correctly, offering more predictable data output.

We've adjusted the configuration and handling of writer modes, such as `write_mode`. This means that the default behavior might have changed (for instance, defaulting to "REPLACE" instead of "CREATE"), or modes like "REPLACE" or "APPEND" are now implemented more accurately.
As a result, how data is saved to your target table is more reliable. For example, if "REPLACE" is the new default, existing data will be overwritten unless specified otherwise. If you use "APPEND", you can now confidently accumulate data. This ensures your data is persisted exactly as intended by the chosen write mode.

## Extractors Now Accurately Use Your UI Settings
Extractors have been updated to correctly interpret and apply parameters set via the user interface, ensuring your configured settings are precisely used.

We've fixed how our backend processes extraction parameters configured through the UI. Previously, settings like specific columns to select, boolean flags, or filters might not have been applied as intended.
Now, parameters such as column lists or filter conditions from the UI are accurately used during data extraction. This means the extracted dataset will precisely match your configuration, leading to more accurate and refined data that aligns with your specifications.
