## Change log (AI generated):
## MotherDuck Extractor: Simpler Configuration & Enhanced Query Control
Our MotherDuck extractor is now more flexible with optional query parameters, default table reads, and query tagging for improved monitoring.

We've rolled out several enhancements to the MotherDuck extractor, making it easier to configure and providing more control over your data extraction process.
### Key Enhancements:
- **Simplified Data Source Definition:** The `query` parameter is now optional. If you don't provide a custom query but specify an input `table_id`, the extractor will automatically perform a `SELECT * FROM your_table_id`. This streamlines the setup for common full-table extractions. Additionally, `table_id` (input table identifier) and `outputTable` (output table name) are now optional, offering more flexibility, especially when your query is self-contained or you manage output naming differently. (Note: `table_id` is required if no `query` is provided for the default `SELECT *` behavior).
- **Improved Query Monitoring:** A new optional `query_tag` parameter allows you to tag your extraction queries. This tag is passed to MotherDuck and included in logs, significantly aiding in monitoring query performance, debugging, and managing costs within your MotherDuck environment.

## MotherDuck Writer: New Load Types & Flexible Configuration
The MotherDuck writer introduces `REPLACE` or `INCREMENTAL` load types and makes `query` and `default_database` parameters optional for greater control.

Updates to the MotherDuck writer bring new data loading options and increased configuration flexibility, giving you more precise control over how data is written to MotherDuck.
### What's New:
- **Selectable Load Types:** A new `load_type` parameter has been introduced. You can now choose between `REPLACE` (the default behavior, which overwrites the destination table) and `INCREMENTAL` (which suggests data will be appended or upserted). This feature is key for managing the state and content of your data in the target system.
- **More Optional Parameters:** The `query` and `default_database` parameters in the writer configuration are now optional. This simplifies setups where a transformation query isn't necessary (e.g., for direct table copies) or when you prefer to use MotherDuck's globally defined default database.

## MotherDuck Component: Important Configuration Structure Update
The MotherDuck component requires an updated configuration structure: all parameters must now be nested under a top-level `parameters` key.

We've restructured the MotherDuck component for improved clarity and consistency in its operation. This involves an important change to how you set up your component configurations.
### Action Required: Update Your `config.json`
All specific settings for extractor or writer actions must now be nested under a top-level `parameters` key within your `config.json` file.
For example, your configuration should now be structured as:
`{"parameters": {"extractor": {...your_extractor_settings...}}}`
or
`{"parameters": {"writer": {...your_writer_settings...}}}`
Please review and update your existing MotherDuck component configurations to align with this new structure. Using the old format will prevent the component from running correctly.
