_Released on 2025-05-29_

**Component:** [keboola.app-embeddings-v2](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.21](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.21)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Component Configuration Update: More Flexibility, Simpler Setup
We've refined component configuration schemas, making certain parameters optional for increased flexibility and easier setup.

These changes primarily involve adjustments to how component configurations are validated, which means the underlying processing logic of the components remains unchanged. However, a broader range of your configurations will now be considered valid and proceed to processing, offering you more adaptable component setups.

### Key Configuration Enhancements:
- **Optional Column Parameters**: The `texts_column` and `ids_column` parameters are no longer strictly required at the top level of your component configuration. This allows for a wider array of valid setups, particularly if your component can infer these columns or if they are only relevant for specific operational modes. Configurations that previously might have failed schema validation due to these missing parameters can now be successfully processed.
- **Streamlined API Key Requirement**: The `api_key` parameter is now consistently enforced as required only at the main, top-level configuration. It is no longer necessary for this to be marked as required within nested, model-specific settings (e.g., for different AI model parameters). This change clarifies the expected structure, ensuring a single, global API key is used, and simplifies the overall schema definition.

Additionally, we've made minor updates to the descriptions and titles of some parameters, such as `api_key` and `api_version`, within the schema. These refinements aim for improved clarity in any user interfaces or documentation generated from the schema and do not alter component behavior or validation rules beyond the `required` field changes detailed above.
