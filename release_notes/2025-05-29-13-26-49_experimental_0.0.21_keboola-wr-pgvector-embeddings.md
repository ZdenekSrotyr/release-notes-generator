## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Important Configuration Updates for Python & Snowflake Components
Excerpt: We've updated configuration validation for Python Custom Processor, Python Transformation V2, and Snowflake Transformation V2. Key changes include optional 'script' content and mandatory structural elements.
Post Detail:
We're refining how configurations are validated for Python Custom Processor, Python Transformation V2, and Snowflake Transformation V2. Please review the following changes as they might affect your existing setups or how you build new ones.

Code 'script' Content is Now Optional:
For Python Custom Processor, Python Transformation V2, and Snowflake Transformation V2, the 'script' field within individual code entries is no longer a required field.
Important Note for Your Python Code: While this offers a change in schema validation, the core Python execution logic of these components has not been altered. If your custom Python scripts assume the 'script' field will always be present, they may encounter errors (like a 'KeyError') or behave differently when a code entry lacks a script. We recommend updating your Python code to gracefully handle such cases, for instance, by checking for the 'script's' presence and skipping the entry or applying a default action if it is missing.

Stricter Structural Requirements for Transformations:
For Python Transformation V2 and Snowflake Transformation V2, your configurations must now include the top-level 'parameters' object and, within 'parameters', the 'blocks' array.
How This Affects You: Configurations that do not meet this structure will now be rejected by our validation process before execution. This change promotes a more consistent and reliable configuration standard for these transformations. If your previous configurations relied on the component's internal handling of missing 'parameters' or 'blocks', these will now need to be explicitly defined.

These adjustments are designed to improve configuration clarity and consistency. We encourage you to review your Python and Snowflake transformation configurations to ensure they align with these new rules and to adapt any custom Python code as needed.
