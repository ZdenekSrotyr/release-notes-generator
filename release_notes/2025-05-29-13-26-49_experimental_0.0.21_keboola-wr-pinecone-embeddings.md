**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Embeddings Component: Key Configuration Fields Now Optional
The Embeddings component (v2) has been updated, making several configuration fields optional for increased flexibility.

We've released version 0.0.21 of the `keboola/component-embeddings-v2`, introducing more flexibility in how you configure the component.

Several previously mandatory configuration fields are now optional. This includes `provider` and `model` within the provider settings, `table_id` and `text_column` within the data settings, and `output_table_name` in the destination settings.

While this update allows for more adaptable configurations, please be aware that the component's core data processing logic has not changed in this version to specifically manage the absence of these fields with new default values or alternative pathways. If these fields are omitted from your configuration, the component might encounter runtime errors or behave unexpectedly. The processing logic remains unchanged for configurations where these fields are provided as before.

This release also incorporates an update to the `keboola-component` base library (to version 2.0.3). This is a minor update with internal corrections unlikely to impact the Embeddings component's data processing.

We advise reviewing your configurations. To prevent potential disruptions, ensure that fields previously considered mandatory are still supplied if they are critical for your data processing tasks.
