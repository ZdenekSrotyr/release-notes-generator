_Released on 2025-05-29_

**Component:** [keboola.wr-qdrant-embeddings](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2)  
**Tag:** [0.0.21](https://github.com/keboola/component-embeddings-v2/releases/tag/0.0.21)  
**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## OpenAI Component: API Key Now Optional for Greater Flexibility
The OpenAI component's API key parameter is no longer required in row configurations, enabling more diverse setup and execution possibilities.

We've enhanced the OpenAI component to provide you with more versatile configuration options. The `"#service_openai_api_key"` parameter is no longer a required field in your configuration row.

This update allows the component to be configured and run even if the OpenAI API key isn't explicitly provided in the row's parameters. Previously, the platform would deem such configurations invalid, preventing execution. Now, the component can execute and will attempt to manage the API key dynamically based on its internal logic.

This change directly impacts how data might be processed:
*   **Centralized Key Management:** The component can now more easily source the OpenAI API key from alternative locations, such as project-level secrets, if it's not found in the row parameters. This can simplify key management and potentially change which OpenAI account is utilized for API calls.
*   **Conditional Execution Paths:** If your component's code is designed to adapt its behavior—for instance, by skipping OpenAI-specific processing (like embedding generation) or operating in a different mode when an API key is absent—these execution paths are now fully supported. This could lead to different data outputs based on the key's availability.
*   **Modified Failure Points:** Should no alternative key be found and no specific fallback logic be implemented for its absence, the component might proceed with its tasks and only encounter an error when an actual API call to OpenAI is attempted without a key. This alters the timing and nature of potential failures, possibly impacting any partial data processing that occurred beforehand.

Essentially, this modification opens up new valid configuration states for the OpenAI component. It allows for different execution strategies within your Python code when interacting with the OpenAI service, directly influencing how, or even if, data is processed by that service.

As part of this update, the component's internal version string has also been incremented (e.g., from "0.0.20" to "0.0.21"). This change is for metadata, logging, and identification purposes and does not alter data processing algorithms.
