## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Power BI Efficiency Boost: Reduced API Load During Refreshes
Excerpt: We've optimized our Power BI component to check dataset refresh status less frequently, significantly decreasing API calls to the Power BI service.
Post Detail:
We've released an enhancement to our Power BI component that optimizes how it monitors your dataset refreshes.
The component will now check the status of a Power BI dataset refresh every 10 seconds, instead of every second. This change is designed to reduce the overall number of API calls made to the Power BI service, leading to more efficient component operation and less strain on the Power BI API, particularly for refreshes that take a while to complete.
This adjustment means there might be a minor delay (up to an additional 9 seconds) in detecting when a refresh has finished or encountered an issue. However, the dataset refresh process itself and the integrity of your data remain unchanged.
As part of this update, we've also improved logging, so you'll see a clear informational message in your job logs when a dataset refresh completes successfully.
