## Python CDC Component Boosted: Upgraded Debezium & Enhanced Stability
Experience enhanced data accuracy and pipeline robustness with the latest Python CDC component update, featuring upgraded Debezium versions and numerous stability improvements.

We're pleased to announce an update to our Python CDC component (version 1.4.5), focused on delivering more accurate and reliable Change Data Capture.

The core of this update involves upgrading the underlying Debezium connectors: the MySQL connector is now version 0.14.5, and the PostgreSQL connector is version 0.17.5. These newer versions can directly impact your captured CDC events. You may benefit from bug fixes that improve data accuracy or completeness (like better handling of certain data types or capturing previously missed changes), performance enhancements, or refinements to event structure and metadata. This means the data flowing through the component will be more dependable.

Alongside these connector upgrades, we've significantly improved the component's robustness. Key enhancements include:
*   **Reliable Debezium Shutdown:** If errors occur during event processing, the Debezium subprocess is now explicitly terminated, preventing orphaned processes and ensuring a cleaner state.
*   **Improved Resource Management:** We've refined how temporary files for SSH keys are handled, ensuring more stable SSH tunnel connections. Output CSV files and configuration files are now managed to guarantee they are properly closed, and the Debezium subprocess lifecycle is also more reliably managed.
*   **Accurate Output Detection:** The check for whether data has been written to an output CSV file is now more precise, relying on actual file size.

These improvements work together to provide a more stable, efficient, and reliable data processing experience with the Python CDC component.
