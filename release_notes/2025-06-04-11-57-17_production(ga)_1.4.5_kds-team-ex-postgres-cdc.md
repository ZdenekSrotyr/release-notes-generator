## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Debezium Components More Resilient: Enhanced Startup Error Handling
Excerpt: Our Debezium-based CDC components now feature improved startup error detection, preventing data issues and bolstering overall processing stability.
Post detail:
We're excited to announce an important enhancement to our Debezium-based Change Data Capture (CDC) components. We've improved the error handling within the Debezium runner to ensure that if the underlying Debezium engine encounters a critical error during its startup sequence, before it begins dispatching data events, the entire process is halted. This crucial update prevents the component from attempting to process data with a faulty or non-operational Debezium instance. By stopping early in such scenarios, we significantly reduce the risk of potential data inconsistencies, partial data capture, or the component hanging indefinitely, ensuring greater data integrity for your pipelines.

Alongside this targeted Debezium enhancement, we've implemented several other under-the-hood improvements to further boost the overall stability and reliability of our data processing components. These include:
-   Ensuring proper closure of file resources to prevent data loss or corruption and avoid resource leaks.
-   Upgrading subprocess management to use context managers, leading to more robust handling of external processes and preventing issues such as zombie processes or resource exhaustion.
-   Correcting the handling of named temporary files to ensure they are properly closed, contributing to smoother operations and preventing resource leaks.

These changes, combined with the enhanced Debezium startup checks, contribute to more robust, reliable, and maintainable data processing operations within Keboola.
