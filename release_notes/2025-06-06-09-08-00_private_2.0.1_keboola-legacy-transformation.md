Python Components: Upgraded Storage Client for Enhanced Data Operations
Python components now utilize an updated Keboola Storage API client, aiming to improve the reliability and efficiency of data input and output.

We've enhanced our Python components by updating the `kbcstorage` library, which is the core client responsible for all interactions with Keboola Storage. While the Python code within the components themselves hasn't been directly modified, they now execute using this upgraded library (from version `0.16.0` to `0.19.0` or newer) for fetching input and writing output data.

This upgrade ensures your Python components benefit from the latest bug fixes, stability improvements, and potential performance enhancements available in the newer `kbcstorage` client. As a result, you may experience more reliable data processing and more robust interactions with Keboola Storage.

This update is part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining a dependable and efficient platform for all your data operations.
