## Change log (AI generated):
## Tableau Component Enhanced: Robust Configuration & Modernized Integration
Our Tableau data refresh component has been significantly updated for improved reliability, featuring a new integration library and stricter configuration validation.

We've upgraded the core of our Tableau component by replacing an older library with the modern `keboola.component` library. This foundational change enhances how the component interacts with the Keboola environment, leading to better stability, easier maintenance, and more standardized operations. As part of this upgrade, the way configuration parameters are accessed and validated internally has been streamlined to align with this new library.

To further boost reliability, we've introduced more comprehensive configuration checks:
- **Essential Parameters Validated:** The component now explicitly verifies the presence of crucial parameters like `#token`, `username`, `server_url`, and `site_id` right at the start. If any are missing, it will halt before attempting any Tableau API calls.
- **Mode-Specific Checks:** Logic has been added to ensure that if you're refreshing a "datasource," the `datasource_id` is provided, and similarly for "workbook" mode and `workbook_id`. This prevents ambiguity and errors by ensuring a specific target is always defined for the refresh operation.

These enhancements mean your Tableau refresh processes are more robust. The component will now ensure all necessary information is present and correct before proceeding, leading to more dependable data updates and fewer troubleshooting headaches.

## Tableau Component Update: Better Connectivity & Refined Debugging
We've updated the Tableau component's SSL certificates for improved connectivity and standardized how debug mode is activated.

To ensure smooth and secure connections to your Tableau servers, we've updated the trusted CA certificates within the component's runtime environment. This includes adding a new SSL certificate and ensuring the system's certificate store is up-to-date. This change can resolve potential SSL connection issues, allowing the component to reliably perform refresh operations over HTTPS, especially if your server's SSL certificate requires newer or specific Certificate Authorities.

Additionally, we've refined how debug mode is activated. The component now checks for the `debug` setting directly within your configuration parameters (`parameters.debug`). This provides a clear and consistent way to enable more detailed logging for troubleshooting purposes, directly managed through your component setup.

These updates contribute to the overall operational stability of the Tableau component and offer improved tools for diagnostics when needed.
