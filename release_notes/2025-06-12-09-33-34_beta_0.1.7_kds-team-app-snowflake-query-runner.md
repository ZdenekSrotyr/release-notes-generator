## Change log (AI generated):
## Snowflake Query Runner: Now with Key-Pair Authentication & Flexible Setup
Enhance your Snowflake connections with new key-pair authentication support and more adaptable configuration options in the Snowflake Query Runner.

We've updated the Snowflake Query Runner to provide more flexibility and security options when connecting to your Snowflake data warehouse.

**Introducing Key-Pair Authentication**
You can now use key-pair authentication, alongside traditional password-based methods, to connect to Snowflake. This allows you to leverage a more secure and often preferred authentication mechanism, making it easier to integrate with Snowflake environments that mandate or favor key-pair credentials. This means you can now process data from a wider range of Snowflake setups.

**More Flexible Configuration Validation**
The component's configuration schema has also been updated for greater flexibility. It will now accept configurations even if specific credential fields (like `password` or `private_key`) are not immediately provided during the setup phase.

This change offers more adaptability when defining your component's parameters. However, please remember: while the configuration itself may pass initial validation more readily, a successful connection to Snowflake at runtime still requires functionally complete credentials. If essential details for your chosen authentication method are missing, connection attempts will fail when the component runs your queries. This shifts the point of error detection for missing credentials from initial setup to runtime, so ensure your configuration contains all necessary authentication details for smooth data processing.

- add anyOf to auth methods in config
