## Change log (AI generated):
## Generative AI Component: New 'Filter' for Empty or Invalid AI Responses
Our Generative AI component now includes a 'filter' error handling setting to automatically discard rows with empty or unparsable AI model outputs.

We've enhanced our Generative AI component to provide greater flexibility in handling how responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are processed.

A new 'filter' option is now available within the `error_handling` configuration parameter. When this mode is selected, any input row that results in an empty, `None`, or otherwise unparsable response from the AI model (including after any internal validation steps) will be automatically filtered out and excluded from your output table.

Previously, these scenarios would consistently generate an error row. This update allows for cleaner and more focused output datasets by directly removing rows where AI processing was unsuccessful, reducing the need for downstream data cleaning and allowing you to concentrate on successfully enriched data.



## Changes:



- better None handling 




- update debuging 




- add filtering for None results 




- refactore code 




- PR #7
