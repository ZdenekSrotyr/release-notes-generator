## Change log (AI generated):
## Google Ad Manager Extractor Now on API v202405
The Google Ad Manager extractor has been upgraded to API v202405, providing access to the latest features and requiring a new `application_name` configuration for enhanced connectivity.

We've upgraded the Google Ad Manager extractor to utilize Google's API version v202405, a significant step up from the previous v202302. This ensures you're working with the most up-to-date functionalities from Google Ad Manager.

Key Changes and Impacts:
*   Latest API Version (v202405): By moving to the newest API, you may gain access to new report types, additional dimensions, or metrics. It's also possible that some previously available data points have been changed or deprecated by Google. We advise reviewing your current report configurations and output data to accommodate any potential schema or content adjustments.
*   New `application_name` Parameter: To enhance compatibility and meet Google's requirements for the new API version, the extractor now includes an `application_name` in its API calls. This is essential for successful authentication and data retrieval. You can now set a custom `application_name` in the component's image parameters. If unspecified, it defaults to "Keboola Google Ad Manager Extractor."

This update allows for more robust data extraction and access to the latest capabilities. Please ensure your component configuration is reviewed, especially for the new `application_name` setting if you need to specify one for your Google integration.
