## Change log (AI generated):
Title: QuickBooks Online Extractor: API Version Upgraded
Excerpt: Our QuickBooks Online extractor now utilizes a newer API version (v75), potentially providing access to new data fields and structural improvements from QuickBooks.
Post detail:
Our QuickBooks Online extractor has been upgraded to utilize a more recent version of the QuickBooks Online API. We've transitioned from API minor version "65" to "75".

This upgrade ensures your data integration benefits from the latest features and data structures offered by QuickBooks Online. As Intuit evolves its API between these versions, you may encounter new data fields, changes to existing data formats, or the deprecation of older elements. By staying current, our extractor helps you maintain a robust and accurate data pipeline from QuickBooks.
