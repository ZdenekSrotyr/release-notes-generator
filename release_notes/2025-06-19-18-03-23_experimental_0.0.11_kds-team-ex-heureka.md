## Change log (AI generated):
## Heureka Connector: Improved Login Error Clarity
We've refined error reporting for Heureka API login failures, now providing more specific exceptions for better troubleshooting within the Keboola platform.

When the Heureka connector encounters a login failure, it will now raise a `UserException` instead of a generic `Exception`. This change enhances how login issues are communicated, leading to clearer error messages and improved error classification in your project events.

While data processing will still be aborted upon a login failure (as it was previously), this more specific exception type helps you and our platform better understand the nature of the problem. The underlying data processing logic, assuming a successful login, remains entirely unchanged. This update is focused on making error diagnosis more straightforward.



## Changes:



- raise user exception when unable to login
