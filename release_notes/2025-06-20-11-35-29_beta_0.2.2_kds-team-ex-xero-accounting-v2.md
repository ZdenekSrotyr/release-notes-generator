## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhance Xero Reporting with Tracking Categories
The Xero extractor component now supports the extraction of Tracking Categories, enabling more detailed financial analysis.

We have enhanced the Xero extractor with a frequently requested feature: the ability to extract Tracking Categories.

This update allows you to get a more granular view of your business performance by pulling data on how you categorize transactions, such as by department, location, or project. By incorporating this data into your Keboola workflows, you can create more detailed and insightful financial reports.

To get started, simply select the new `TrackingCategories` endpoint in your extractor's configuration. A new table will be created in your Storage with `TrackingCategoryID` as its primary key, ready to be joined with your other Xero data.



## Changes:



- add TrackingCategories endpoint
