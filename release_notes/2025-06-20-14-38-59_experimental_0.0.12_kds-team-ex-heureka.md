## Debug Web Scraper Timeouts with Automatic Screenshots
Our web scraping component now provides automatic screenshots and enhanced logging to help you diagnose page load timeouts more easily.

We know that debugging page load timeouts in web scraping can be challenging. To make this process more transparent and efficient, we've introduced new features to help you quickly identify and resolve these issues.

When a page fails to load within the specified time, the web scraping component will now automatically capture a screenshot of the problematic page. This screenshot is saved as a new artifact in your job's output files, giving you a visual snapshot of what the browser was rendering at the moment of the timeout. This can help you spot issues like consent pop-ups, slow-loading elements, or anti-scraping mechanisms that may be causing the delay.

In addition to the screenshot, we have also enhanced our logging. Timeout error messages now include a unique job ID, making it easier to correlate specific scraper failures with other system events for more thorough debugging. These updates provide you with better tools to troubleshoot failures, reducing guesswork and helping you get your scrapers back on track faster.



## Changes:



- log Ray ID when a timeout error occurs 




- save screenshot to artifacts when a timeout error occurs
