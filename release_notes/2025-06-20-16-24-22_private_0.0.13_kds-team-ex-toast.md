## Toast API Extractor Now Includes Dining Options Data
The Toast API Extractor has been updated to support the "dining options" dataset, allowing you to access more granular data about your restaurant's services.

We have expanded the capabilities of our Toast API Extractor. With the latest update, you can now pull the "dining options" dataset directly into your Keboola project.

This new addition allows you to extract valuable information about your service types, such as dine-in, takeout, and delivery. Analyzing this data helps you gain a clearer understanding of customer behavior, identify popular dining trends, and optimize your operational focus.

To access this new data, simply update your component configuration to include the "dining-options" dataset. A new output table will be created in your Storage, ready for analysis.
