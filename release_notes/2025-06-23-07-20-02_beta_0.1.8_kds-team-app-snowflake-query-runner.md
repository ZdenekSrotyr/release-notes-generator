## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Snowflake Connector Updated for Modern Account Formats
Excerpt: To improve compatibility, our Snowflake connector has been updated to authenticate using the modern account identifier format.
Post detail:
We have released an update to our Snowflake connector to enhance how it authenticates with the Snowflake database. This change aligns our component with modern Snowflake standards for establishing a connection.

Specifically, the connector now uses the account_identifier parameter instead of the legacy account parameter. This update ensures full compatibility with all Snowflake account types, including newer formats that incorporate an organization and account name (e.g., myorganization-myaccount). By adopting this modern identifier, we are future-proofing the connector and ensuring reliable data access for all our users.

This is a backend improvement that requires no action from you. Your existing configurations will continue to work as expected, as the component automatically handles the new authentication parameter.
