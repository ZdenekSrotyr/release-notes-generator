## Component Optimization for Enhanced Performance and Reliability
We've refactored a core component's architecture to improve performance, optimize memory, and increase operational resilience.

We have rolled out a significant internal update to a component's processing engine, focused on delivering a faster, more stable, and more efficient user experience. These under-the-hood changes require no action on your part but enhance the component's overall performance.

Key improvements include:
- A new, lightweight client for discovering input files from Keboola Storage. This change optimizes the componentâ€™s startup phase, improving performance and reducing memory usage before data processing begins.
- An upgraded library for writing processed data to your output tables. This ensures you benefit from the latest performance improvements and bug fixes when saving your results.
- More robust error handling for API communications. The component is now more resilient to transient issues, helping prevent job failures and improving overall reliability.

These enhancements work together to create a more seamless and dependable data processing experience within the Keboola platform.
