**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## More Efficient and Robust Data Downloads in Python Components
We've updated our Python components to download data more efficiently, reducing memory usage and improving stability when processing large tables.

We've rolled out an important update to our Python components that significantly enhances how they handle data downloads from Keboola Storage. The internal mechanism for fetching input tables has been completely rewritten to use a lightweight, custom implementation that directly streams data from storage to disk.

This change has a major impact on performance, especially for users working with very large datasets. By streaming data, we drastically reduce the component's memory footprint during the data loading phase. This makes the process more efficient and significantly lowers the risk of memory-related failures, ensuring greater stability for your data pipelines.

Additionally, we've broadened the error handling during the download process, making the components more resilient to potential network issues or other unexpected problems. This optimization requires no changes on your part and contributes to a more robust and scalable experience across the platform.
