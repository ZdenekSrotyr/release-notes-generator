## Change log (AI generated):
## Prevent Extraction Failures with Automatic Column Name Shortening
This update introduces automatic column name shortening to prevent extraction failures, making component behavior more consistent and reliable.

We've enhanced our components to automatically handle column names that exceed the storage backend's length limit. This functionality, previously managed by custom logic within individual components, is now a standardized, non-optional behavior powered by our core component library.

This change significantly improves the reliability of your data pipelines by preventing extraction failures caused by overly long column names. By centralizing this logic, we ensure consistent behavior across the platform. When a column name is too long, it will now be automatically truncated and appended with a unique hash of the original name.

Please be aware that this update may affect the schema of your output tables if they contain long column names. While the data within the table rows remains completely unchanged, any affected column names will be shortened. No action is required unless your downstream processes rely on specific, hard-coded column names that are now subject to shortening.



## Changes:



- add optional shortening logic for column names 




- add format for short_headers in UI 




- flake changes 




- flake changes in component 




- short_headers param manipulation in correct order 




- Dockerfile optimization and new try for shorter column names 






- fix for shorting function 




- another fix for shorting logic 




- updated kbc lib + implementatio of the new logic from kbc lib 




- rem of git+ from kbc branch url 




- add git to dockerfile and fixed url in requirements 




- url in requirements another try 




- add --no-cache-dir to dockerfile + component adjustment for better local testing 




- finalization: parameter removed and shorting logic setuped in kbc library by default, Dockerfile optimization 




- add description about shortening logic 






- shortening descriptions added to long description and UI 




- add logic for creating table with shortened column names 




- do not include unnecessary files in Docker image üêã 




- PR #3
