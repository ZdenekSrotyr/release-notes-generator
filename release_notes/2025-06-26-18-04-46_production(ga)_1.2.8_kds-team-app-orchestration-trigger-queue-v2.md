## Change log (AI generated):
## Enhanced Stability for Orchestration Triggers
An update to our orchestration trigger component improves stability by standardizing how orchestration IDs are processed, preventing potential errors.

We have released a small but important update to the component used for triggering orchestrations.

Previously, if an orchestration ID was configured as a number instead of text, it could lead to an unexpected error. This update resolves the issue by ensuring the orchestration ID is always handled correctly as a string, regardless of how it is provided in the configuration.

This change enhances the component's reliability and prevents potential pipeline failures, contributing to more robust and predictable workflows. No action is required on your part.
