## Change log (AI generated):
Title
Speed Up Your Zendesk Sync with Incremental Loads

Excerpt
Our Zendesk extractor now incrementally loads organizations, resulting in faster and more efficient data syncs.

Post detail
We have updated our Zendesk extractor to improve the performance and efficiency of data synchronization for organizations.

Previously, the component would perform a full data load on every run, downloading all organization records. With this update, we have switched to a more intelligent incremental extraction method.

On all subsequent runs after the initial full load, the component will now only fetch organizations that have been created or updated since the last successful execution. This change significantly reduces run times and lowers the number of API calls made to Zendesk, making your data pipelines faster and more robust.

This improvement is enabled by default, and no action is required on your part.



## Changes:



- fix pipeline 




- change organizations api from iso to incremental
