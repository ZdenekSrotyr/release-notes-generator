## Change log (AI generated):
## Transform Your Data with Blazing-Fast SQL Using DuckDB

We are introducing a new transformation component that leverages the in-memory DuckDB engine for powerful and efficient SQL-based data manipulation.

We are excited to announce a new component designed to bring the power and speed of DuckDB directly into your data flows. This new transformation component allows you to perform complex data manipulations using standard SQL, executed with the high performance of an in-memory database.

The component streamlines your workflow by automatically loading your input tables into an in-memory DuckDB instance, intelligently inferring schemas and data types. From there, you can execute a sequence of your own SQL queries to filter, join, aggregate, and reshape your data exactly as needed. Because all operations run in-memory, transformations are completed with exceptional speed.

Once your SQL transformations are complete, the component seamlessly exports the resulting tables back into Keboola Storage as CSV files, ready for the next step in your data pipeline. This provides a powerful, self-contained environment for performing sophisticated SQL-based data processing without the overhead of setting up an external database.
