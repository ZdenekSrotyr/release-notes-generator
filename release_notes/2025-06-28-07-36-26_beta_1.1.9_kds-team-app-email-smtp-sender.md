**Tag:** [1.1.9](https://github.com/keboola/component-email-smtp-sender/releases/tag/1.1.9)  
**Stage:** BETA


## Change log (AI generated):
## Seamless O365 Email Sending Without Attachments
This update resolves an error that occurred when sending emails using O365 OAuth authentication without any attachments.

### Post detail
We have fixed a bug within the `send_email_via_o365_oauth` function that affected sending emails without attachments.

Previously, attempting to send an email using O365 OAuth authentication without providing any files would cause a `TypeError`, leading to a failed execution. With this update, the function now works as expected in this scenario.

The process will now complete successfully, ensuring your automated email notifications and reports are delivered reliably, with or without attached files.



## Changes:



- default value for attachment_paths is [] instead of None so send_email_via_o365_oauth doesn't fail 




- PR #5
