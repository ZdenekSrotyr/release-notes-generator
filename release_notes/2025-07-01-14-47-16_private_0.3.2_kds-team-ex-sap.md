Title: Fine-Tune Your SAP Extractions for Faster, More Flexible Runs
Excerpt: Introducing selective resource processing for the SAP Extractor, enabling targeted data runs for greater speed and flexibility.
Post Detail:
We are excited to announce an update to our SAP Extractor that gives you more granular control over your data extractions. With the introduction of selective resource processing, you can now run your component for a specific subset of tables and files, making your data pipelines faster and more efficient.

This new functionality is enabled by an optional `resources` parameter in your component configuration. Simply provide a list of the resource IDs you wish to process, and the extractor will target only those items. If the parameter is omitted, the component behaves as before, processing all configured tables and files. This is ideal for situations where you only need to update a single table, debug a specific resource, or run partial extractions without creating multiple configurations.

To make these targeted runs even more robust, we have also changed how resource metadata is validated. The extractor now validates each table or file just before it is processed, rather than checking everything at the start. This ensures that a run can succeed with a valid subset of resources, even if other, unselected resources in the same configuration are invalid.

These enhancements are designed to provide greater flexibility and improve the reliability of your SAP data integration workflows. We look forward to seeing how you use this new capability to streamline your projects.
