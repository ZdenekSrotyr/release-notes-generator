**Stage:** EXPERIMENTAL


## Change log (AI generated):
## Unleash Blazing-Fast SQL with DuckDB Transformations
Execute high-performance SQL transformations directly in your workflows with the new DuckDB component.

We're excited to announce the release of the new DuckDB Transformation component, bringing the power of high-performance, in-memory analytics to your Keboola projects. This component allows you to write standard SQL to efficiently process and transform data right within your flows.

This initial release establishes a powerful foundation for your data operations, moving beyond a simple template to a fully functional transformation engine.

### Key Features:

- **Powerful SQL Engine:** Write and execute complex SQL queries on your input tables. The component uses an in-memory DuckDB instance to create views from your input files, run your scripts, and write the results to output tables, integrating perfectly into your data flows.
- **Performance & Resource Control:** Fine-tune your transformations by configuring the `memory_limit` and `threads` for the DuckDB instance. This helps you optimize for speed on large datasets and prevent out-of-memory errors during complex queries.
- **Accurate Data Ingestion:** Ensure data integrity with improved control over CSV parsing. The component automatically treats the first row as a header and allows you to configure how many rows are scanned to infer data types, preventing mismatches and data corruption.



## Changes:



- Init component structure and configuration schema 




- adjust configuration to fit transformations 




- add threads and max_memory parameters to the client 




- component.py - materialize in_tables as views, iteration over queries, out mapping based on the config 




- switch to UV 




- added tests 




- added sample config, removed json UI 




- added flake8 




- removed unused import 




- fix out table name 




- added dtypes_infer param 




- set has_header to True, change default max_memory 




- config - change default values 




- add empty config schemas 




- PR #1
