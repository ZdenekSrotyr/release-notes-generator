## Change log (AI generated):
## Level Up Your Python Code: Git Integration and Isolated Environments
The Python transformation component now supports sourcing code directly from Git repositories and running it in isolated, version-controlled virtual environments.

We are thrilled to announce a major upgrade to our Python transformation component, designed to bring professional software development practices to your data pipelines. You can now build more complex, reliable, and maintainable data processing applications directly within Keboola.

### Run Code Directly from Git Repositories
Move beyond inline scripts. You can now connect your Python transformation to a remote Git repository. Simply provide the repository URL, select a branch, and specify an entry-point script. This empowers you to manage your transformation code with version control, collaborate with your team, and handle complex, multi-file projects with ease.

### Isolated and Reproducible Environments
Every transformation run now executes in its own dedicated virtual environment. You can select a specific Python version (from 3.9 to 3.12) to ensure consistency and leverage the latest language features. This isolation prevents dependency conflicts and guarantees that your code runs in a predictable, reproducible environment every time.

### Simplified Dependency Management
Managing your project's libraries is now seamless. The component automatically detects and installs packages from a `requirements.txt` file located in the root of your cloned Git repository. This works alongside the existing option to specify packages in the configuration, giving you full control over your project‚Äôs dependencies.

These enhancements also allow your scripts to import custom modules and packages from your repository, enabling more organized and complex applications. We're excited to see the sophisticated data applications you'll build with these new capabilities
