## Change log (AI generated):
Title: Streamlining Component Development for Faster Updates
Excerpt: We've made internal structural improvements to the Iceberg Writer to accelerate future development and enhance stability.

Post detail:
As part of our continuous effort to improve the Keboola platform, we have recently performed some internal housekeeping on the Iceberg Writer component.

These structural changes reorganize our codebase, making it more efficient for our development team to manage and update components. This is a foundational step that will allow us to deliver new features and improvements to you more quickly and reliably in the future.

There are no changes to the writer's functionality or performance, and no action is required on your part.
