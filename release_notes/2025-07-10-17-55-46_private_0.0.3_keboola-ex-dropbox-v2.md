## Change log (AI generated):
## Streamlined Data Destination for Dropbox Component
The Dropbox component now automatically creates a dedicated output bucket, simplifying configuration and standardizing data storage.

We have updated the Dropbox component to simplify how output data is handled. With this change, the option to manually configure an `output_bucket` has been removed.

Instead, the component now automatically creates and writes data to a dedicated bucket specific to your configuration. The output bucket will follow the naming pattern `in.c-keboola-component-dropbox-<CONFIG_ID>`, ensuring that your data lands in a predictable and organized location within Keboola Storage. This streamlines the setup process and improves consistency across your projects.

Additionally, the `debug` parameter has been removed to standardize logging. The component will now consistently use the `INFO` logging level for all operations.



## Changes:



- Addressed PR comments (simplified config by removing bucket + debug) and updated Python environment to 3.13 + better tooling (Ruff, uv) 




- Added missing --system flag to uv install command inside of the Dockerfile 




- Adjusted Run build_n_test.sh step inside of the Github actions 




- Fixed failing unit tests and tweaking logs
