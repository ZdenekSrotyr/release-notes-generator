Title:
New Dropbox Extractor: Bring Your Files and Their History to Keboola

Excerpt:
Seamlessly extract files and their complete revision history from Dropbox directly into your Keboola project.

Post detail:
We are excited to announce the release of our brand-new Dropbox Extractor. This component has been completely rewritten to provide a robust and efficient way to ingest data from your Dropbox account into Keboola Storage.

Now you can effortlessly integrate your Dropbox files into your data workflows. Key features of the new extractor include:

- **Flexible File Extraction:** Download specific files from your Dropbox account. You can choose to fetch only the latest version of a file for up-to-date reporting, or download all historical revisions to analyze changes over time.
- **Complete Version History:** The "Revisions" mode is perfect for auditing, tracking changes, or building a complete historical archive of your important documents and datasets.
- **Rich Metadata Manifests:** For every downloaded file, the extractor automatically generates a manifest file. This manifest includes valuable Dropbox metadata such as file ID, display path, revision number, size, and server modification date, providing crucial context for your data pipelines.

Built on a new, modular architecture, the Dropbox Extractor is designed for reliability and performance, making it easier than ever to turn your stored files into actionable insights.
