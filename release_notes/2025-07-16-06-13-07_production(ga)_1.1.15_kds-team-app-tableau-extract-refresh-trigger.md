## Change log (AI generated):
Prevent Failed Runs with Smarter Configuration Validation
Components now feature enhanced pre-run validation, providing clearer error messages to prevent runs with invalid configurations.

We are introducing a significant improvement to how components handle configurations. Components can now perform advanced pre-run validation based on stack-level requirements. This means that if a specific setup requires certain parameters—such as a particular mode or field—the component will check for them before starting the job.

This change prevents jobs from running with incomplete or invalid settings that would have inevitably failed later. Instead of wasting time and encountering a vague error mid-process, the component will now fail immediately with a clear and actionable error message. This feedback will guide you directly to the configuration issue, making troubleshooting faster and more straightforward.

This enhancement is powered by a new custom error-handling system designed to provide more specific and helpful feedback directly within the Keboola UI, improving overall component reliability and user experience.



## Changes:



- update gitignore 




- Add validation for required fields and poll mode if is these values are set as required in stack parameter setting 




- move validation to init 




- fix loading stack params from basic configuration 




- add try excepr block 




- Change value error to user exception 




- PR #5
