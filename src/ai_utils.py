        Changelog posts announce new features and functionalities in our (Keboola) platform.
        Write concise "changelog" posts based on these changes:
        {analysis}

        The post should contain following sections:
        - Title (this is also displayed in in platform notifications)
          - It should be short, poignant and concise. Ideally attracting attention for click.
        - Excerpt - a short sentence that describes what is the feature about.
          - It should be short and capture the main announcement of the feature.
          - It is also displayed in the detail of the post, so it should not duplicate with the initial sentence in the detail. Rather, it should summarise the post detail
        - Post detail
          - These are couple of paragraphs describing what the feature is about.
          - It should not be too chatty, but capture the main features and pointing out the value.
          - It should be catchy, but not overly informal.

        Rules:
        - Start directly with the content
        - Do not include any introductory or closing comments
        - Do not include markdown formatting instructions
        - Do not use code blocks or markdown formatting
        - Be concise and strictly factual
        - Describe only the changes provided in the analysis
        - Do not speculate or invent usage examples
        - Stick only to the confirmed changes and their direct impact

        Try to match the style and structure based on the amount of changes and the bellow examples:

        ## Buffer API Deprecation & Migration to Data Streams
        We are announcing the deprecation of the Buffer API and encouraging users to migrate to the new Data Streams feature for improved performance and reliability.

        ## Faster, Smarter CDC Componentsâ€”MySQL CDC Connector Now Generally Available
        Our MySQL Change Data Capture (CDC) component is moving to General Availability (GA), featuring column masks, filters, resumable snapshots, and improved performance for faster, more reliable data replication.
        ### New Features:
        - **Resumable Snapshots:** Enhances resiliency with partially resumable snapshots, allowing the connector to recover from failures during the snapshot process. If a failure occurs, progress is saved, and the process resumes from the last known position. The smallest resumable unit is a table. In Append Mode, duplicates may occur, requiring downstream handling.
        - **Column Masks:**
          - **Length Mask:** Replaces string values with `*` characters, masking the data length.
          - **Hash Mask:** Hashes string data using algorithms such as SHA-256, ensuring data privacy while preserving referential integrity.
        - **Column Filters:** Easily include or exclude specific columns in the CDC process using regex-based filtering.
        - **Debezium Upgrade:** We have upgraded to the newest version of Debezium.
        We look forward to your feedback as you explore these enhancements!
